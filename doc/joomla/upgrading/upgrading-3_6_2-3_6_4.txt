===============================================
We're always changing this, so this file is mostly to keep track of
what was done the last time or two, in case we find issues, and to
give us a starting point, with appropriate cautions and tips, for
next time.

[ ] 2016-08-29: 3.5.1 to 3.6.0

Before You Start
----------------
0. On ALL hosts: backup DB and ensure code matches what is in github
   bu jm 01-before_upgrading_3.5.0_to_3.6.0
   gojmj
   git status
   git pull
1. Decide which host to do most of the work on:
   jane - moving production to barbara, which is also running Ubuntu 16.04
       Never updated lauren last time
       May not even bother with bette this time...

 2016-08-29: Notes on Upgrading From 3.5.1 to 3.6.0
====================================================
There are some major caveats in upgrading these versions!  (3.6.1 is apparently a bad release)
   https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5666-the-joomla-3-6-1-update.html
It says to "Update to Joomla! 3.6.0 through the Joomla! Update component"
   https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Updating_from_an_existing_version
Looks easy enough but let's do some checks first:

1. Check and fix file permissions
   System Information -> Folder Permissions
   If one or more of these is Unwritable, run these commands and recheck:
      gojmj
      ./fix_permissions.sh   # will ask for password to run sudo commands
   To get configuration.php to show up as writable, may need to:
   o  ** TEMPORARILY ** break the link and
   o  ** TEMPORARILY ** copy the file from ../gitignored
   rm configuration.php
   cp ../gitignored/configuration.php .
   sudo chgrp www-data configuration.php
   chmod 775 configuration.php
   Recheck in back end:
      System Information -> Folder Permissions
2. Trying Components -> Joomla Update
   Popup: "ERROR: Invalid login"  (getting deja vu)
   Doesn't seem to be doing anything....
2.1 Update Installer Plugin
-> Try updating the installer plugin first
   Control Panel -> (red banner) "1 Extension Update(s) are available"
   Click on "View Updates"
   Click the "Clear Cache" button
   Click the "Find Updates" button
   Check the "Installer - Install from Web" checkbox
   Click the "Update" button
   Results:
      "Warning - JInstaller: :Install: Can't find XML setup file."
      "Message - Updating plugin was successful."
   Click the "Clear Cache" button (safety check)
   Click the "Find Updates" button
   Results:
      "No updates available"
2.2 Try again
   Trying Components -> Joomla Update
   Click the "Clear Cache" button (always try to be safe)
   Click the "Install the Update" button
   Popup: "ERROR: Invalid login"  (getting deja vu)
   Doesn't seem to be doing anything....
   Not seeing any recent posts about this....
3. This page offers three options:
   **************************************************************
   *** THIS DID NOT WORK - KEEPING FOR FUTURE REFERENCE ONLY  ***
   *** PLEASE SKIP TO STEP 4 AND IGNORE THIS MESS - THANK YOU ***
   **************************************************************
   https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Updating_Joomla_(Install_Method)
   They all assume I am using something like Go Daddy or CPanel
   Components -> Joomla Update
   Download zip file "Update package URL"
3.1 Unpack the zip file in /var/www/joomoowebsites.com/htdocs/unpack
   gojmh
   mkdir unpack
   cd unpack
   ls -altr ~/Downloads/
   mv ~/Downloads/Joomla_3.6.0-Stable-Update_Package.zip .
   cd ../../downloads/
   cp ../htdocs/unpack/Joomla_3.6.0-Stable-Update_Package.zip .
   cd -     # back to /var/www/joomoowebsites.com/htdocs/unpack
3.2 Install the new code
-> Trying Option 2: Install from Directory
   (Admin) -> Extensions -> Manage -> Install
   Install from folder (tab)
   Enter the following value for "Install folder:"
      /var/www/joomoowebsites.com/htdocs/unpack
   Get errors - with both the .zip file and with unzipped .zip file:
   ** Warning: JInstaller: :Install: Can't find XML setup file.
   ** Error: Path does not have a valid package.  Unable to find install package
-> Trying Option 3: Upload a Package File
   (Admin) -> Extensions -> Manage -> Install
   Upload Package File (tab)
   Browse - select downloaded file (Joomla_3.6.0-Stable-Update_Package.zip)
   Click the Upload and Install button
   ** Does not do anything except spin for a second or two max
-> Updated php.ini and fixed all warnings in:
   Extensions -> Manage -> Warnings
   ** Try Option 3 again! -> Same result
   ** Try Option 2 again! -> Same result (both zipped and unzipped)
-> Try Option 1: Install from URL
   Using URL from Components -> Joomla Update , i.e.:
      https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/releases/download/3.6.0/Joomla_3.6.0-Stable-Update_Package.zip
   Results: more errors!
   ** Warning: JInstaller: :Install: Can't find XML setup file.
   ** Error: Unable to find install package
   *******************************
   *** ABOVE STEP DID NOT WORK ***
   *** USING MANUAL PROCEDURE  ***
   *******************************
4. Fall back to manual procedure (as usual)
   See very bottom of this page:
      https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5666-the-joomla-3-6-1-update.html
   Refers to this page:
      https://gist.github.com/mbabker/d7bfb4e1e2fbc6b7815a733607f89281
   Process actually looks similar to what we did last time
4.1 Overview of preparatory steps (used last time and previously covered above)
   Check DB Schema: Extensions -> Manage -> Database
   Download Joomla_3.6.0-Stable-Update_Package.zip
   Fix permissions
4.2 A process similar to this worked last time:
   gojmj
   cp ../../downloads/Joomla_3.6.0-Stable-Update_Package.zip .
   unzip -o Joomla_3.6.0-Stable-Update_Package.zip
   rm Joomla_3.6.0-Stable-Update_Package.zip
   **************************
   *** DO NOT ACCESS SITE ***
   **************************
4.3 Now for the special script part - see URLs immediately above
   github gist: Download zip file from:
      https://gist.github.com/mbabker/d7bfb4e1e2fbc6b7815a733607f89281
   gojmh
   cp ~/Downloads/d7bfb4e1e2fbc6b7815a733607f89281-4f8bd9cfd2c54f853ca99bae3033586a81f9f236.zip ../downloads
   mkdir -p unpack/script/
   cp ../downloads/d7bfb4e1e2fbc6b7815a733607f89281-4f8bd9cfd2c54f853ca99bae3033586a81f9f236.zip unpack/script/
   cd unpack/script/
   unzip d7bfb4e1e2fbc6b7815a733607f89281-4f8bd9cfd2c54f853ca99bae3033586a81f9f236.zip
   l d7bfb4e1e2fbc6b7815a733607f89281-4f8bd9cfd2c54f853ca99bae3033586a81f9f236
   cp d7bfb4e1e2fbc6b7815a733607f89281-4f8bd9cfd2c54f853ca99bae3033586a81f9f236/postupdate.php ../../joomoowebsites.com
   gojmj
   mv postupdate.php administrator
4.4 Run the postupdate.php script, then remove it:
   Run it in the browser:
      jane.joomoowebsites.com/administrator/postupdate.php
   Response:
      "Update to 3.6.0 completed successfully."
   gojmj
   rm administrator/postupdate.php
4.5 Check:
   Extensions -> Manage -> Database
      "Database table structure is up to date."
   System -> System Information
      Joomla Version: 3.6.0
5. Upgrade to 3.6.2
   Note: now at 3.6.0, still need to upgrade to 3.6.2
5.1 Commit code and backup database
   gojmj
   git add --all
   gs
   gc 'Upgraded to 3.6.0.' ; gpom
   bu jm 02-before_upgrading_3.6.0_to_3.6.2
5.2 Which to use?
   Option 1: found via joomla.org/download.html:
      Joomla_3.6.x_to_3.6.2-Stable-Patch_Package.zip
   Option 2: found via Admin -> Components -> Joomla Update (-> 1st tab: Live Update)
      Joomla_3.6.2-Stable-Update_Package.zip
-> Picking option 2:
   gojmh
   cd downloads
   mv ~/Downloads/Joomla_3.6.2-Stable-Update_Package.zip .
5.3 Trying the second tab on the page:
      Components -> Joomla Update -> 2nd tab: Upload and Update
   Maybe it is the firewall that is causing the update to fail?
   Apparently not.
   Results:
   ** No error messages, does not upgrade **
5.4 Oops forgot to update the plugin!
   Extensions -> Manage -> Update
   Click the "Clear Cache" button
   Click the "Find Updates" button
   Check the "Installer - Install from Web" checkbox
   Click the "Update" button
   Results - 1st attempt:
      Copy failed:
         /var/www/joomoowebsites.com/htdocs/joomoowebsites.com/tmp/install_57c4ea4a2a024/admin/access.xml to
         /var/www/joomoowebsites.com/htdocs/joomoowebsites.com/administrator/components/com_joomlaupdate/access.xml

   Retry - same results
   *********************
   *** Well crap.... ***
   *********************
5.5 When will I learn to:
-> Skip the backend folderol and just go with downloading and unzipping the update package?
   But: will it still work without the plugin that I could not install in step 5.4?
   gojmj
   cp ../../downloads/Joomla_3.6.2-Stable-Update_Package.zip .
   unzip -o Joomla_3.6.2-Stable-Update_Package.zip
   rm Joomla_3.6.2-Stable-Update_Package.zip
   Run the post update script from:
      https://gist.github.com/mbabker/d7bfb4e1e2fbc6b7815a733607f89281
   Download a zip of the gist
   gojmh
   mv ~/Downloads/d7bfb4e1e2fbc6b7815a733607f89281-4f8bd9cfd2c54f853ca99bae3033586a81f9f236.zip unpack/
   cd unpack/
   unzip d7bfb4e1e2fbc6b7815a733607f89281-4f8bd9cfd2c54f853ca99bae3033586a81f9f236.zip
   cp d7bfb4e1e2fbc6b7815a733607f89281-4f8bd9cfd2c54f853ca99bae3033586a81f9f236/postupdate.php ~/tmp
   gojmj
   mv ~/tmp/postupdate.php administrator/
5.6 Run the postupdate.php script, then remove it:
   Run it in the browser:
      jane.joomoowebsites.com/administrator/postupdate.php
   Response:
      "Update to 3.6.2 completed successfully."
   gojmj
   rm administrator/postupdate.php
5.7 Check:
   Extensions -> Manage -> Database
      "Database table structure is up to date."
   System -> System Information
      Joomla Version: 3.6.2
6. Backup and cleanup
   gojmj
   git add --all
   gs
   gc 'Upgraded to 3.6.2.' ; gpom
   bu jm 03-after_upgrading_3.6.0_to_3.6.2
   gobu
   toBarbara joomoowebsites.com-2016_08_29-jane-03-after_upgrading_3.6.0_to_3.6.2.sql.gz
   tarHome
6.1 Replace hard copy of configuration.php with link.
   diff configuration.php ../gitignored/configuration.php
   rm configuration.php ; ln -s ../gitignored/configuration.php .
   ls -al
   cd ../gitignored/
   rd configuration.php
   ci -l configuration.php
7. Note: Updating barbara (also running Ubuntu 16.04), the new server, only

Upgrading New Production host:
------------------------------
New production host (server) is barbara.
1. Backup current DB and restore final copy of DB from jane:
   bu jm  01-before_upgrading_3.5.1_to_3.6.2          # IF NOT DONE ALREADY, DO IT NOW
   rs -h jane -d 2016_08_29 jm 03-after_upgrading_3.6.0_to_3.6.2
2. Pull the code and fix the permissions
   gojmj
   git pull
   fix_permissions.sh  # Does checking this file in pose a security risk?  I don't see how, but...
3. Ensure configuration.php matches that on jane:
   gojmj
   cd ../gitignored/
   diffJane configuration.php
4. Test in browswer
   Test front end in browser
   - Check a few menu options
   - Check articles with images
   Test back end in browser
   - System -> System Information -> System Information (check Joomla version)
   - System -> System Information -> Folder Permissions (Unwritable configuration.php is ok)
   - Extensions -> Manage -> Database (check schema version)
5. Backup DB and we are done:
   bu j  02-after_upgrade
