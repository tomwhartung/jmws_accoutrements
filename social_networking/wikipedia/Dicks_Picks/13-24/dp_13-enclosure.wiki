==Enclosure==

Included with the release is a single sheet folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure.   The front duplicates the cover of the CD, and the back is mostly black, with a white stripe across the bottom above a circular grey outline of a skull with the number 13 inside.

Inside the enclosure, the page on the left contains a single black-and-white photograph of the band on stage, taken looking down on them from an elevated position.  The page on the right lists the contents of and credits for the release.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 13, &copy; 1981, 1999.</ref>
