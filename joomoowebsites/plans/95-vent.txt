 Sometimes We Need to Vent
===========================
Job searching is like the new smoking.
I feel like I am doing it just out of habit.
It is not doing anything for me but sucking up time that could be put to much better use elsewhere.
Feels like jumping through randomly-placed invisible hoops that I cannot see until it's too late
Feels like I am trying to fit into oddly-shaped places, and when my effort fails, the only feedback is "you didn't fit."
Seems like it would be much easier to say "I am this shape, if you want one of these services, let me know, else go away."
