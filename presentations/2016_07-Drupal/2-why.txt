 Why Would Someone Do Such a Thing?
====================================

Really, just mainly out of curiosity.

A side goal: intuitively it seems to me that knowing about LAMP CMSes would be a good start to getting possible freelance work.

Another side goal: CMS selection for Groja/SeeOurMinds.com

Ultimately though, just mainly out of curiosity.
