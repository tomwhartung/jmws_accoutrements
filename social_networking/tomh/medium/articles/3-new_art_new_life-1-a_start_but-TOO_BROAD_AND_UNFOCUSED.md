Having given it some thought, I have decided to abandon this line of thought for a new one.

It seems prudent though to save this for possible future reference.

# Title

The New Art - The New Life: 100 Years Later

# Goal - The Big Picture

To be able to reference this article in a subsequent article about my vision, and
to be able to reference the article about my vision in a subsequent article about the
goals and reasons for creating seeourminds.com .

# Songs

- What's So Funny 'Bout Peace Love and Understanding
- Love Is All You Need
- Love Is All Is Alright (High Universal Morality)

# My Point

I like Mondrian's idealism and want to contribute to the awareness of the need for more
equlibrium and desire for equivalent relationships.

Or something like that.

# My Take

One can't create the same sort art that Mondrian created, for that would not be art.

## Ideas I Like:

- Equilibrium
- Honesty
- Learning about and revealing inner traits and energies

## Parallels With Archetypes

- Breaking things down into essential elements (N/S and F/T) so that we can see them
- Removing distracting surface shit

## Themes

There is soooo much here, hundreds of lines of just quotes, before I add my comments and interpretations.

There is obviously enough here to motivate writing multiple articles.

These themes run through these quotes:

- **General/Best**
- **Team Building**
- **Progress**
- **Diversity**
- **Liberty**
- **Opposites and the Importance of Equilibrium**
- **Death and Our Personalities**
- **High Universal Morality**
- **Purified Forms**
- **Equivalent Mutual Relationships**

For example, I am already committed to writing a series of articles about **Team Building,** so now is a good time to
start identifying supporting material for that theme.

# Choosing Quotes for This Article

Want to use only the **best 3-4 quotes** for this article.

Choose quotes that express the following core themes:

- **General/Best**
- **Progress**
- **Opposites and the Importance of Equilibrium**
- **Purified Forms**
- **Equivalent Mutual Relationships**

Save the others for subsequent articles, e.g., the Team Building articles for LinkedIn.

- **Team Building** - Save for later!

# Possible Ending

This short book was not published during his lifetime.
I believe this is because he was so far ahead of his time.
It is also so abstract that it is difficult to understand - even for me, and I love abstract stuff!

# Body

In 1911, the Dutch painter [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) (1876-1944) moved from The Netherlands to Paris.
He soon began contributing to the
[De Stijl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl) - Dutch for "The Style" - art movement.

Mondrian started out painting representational, "particular" paintings of such things as trees and landscapes.
His paintings gradually became more and more abstract until all representation was "annihilated."

Reduced to only the essential elements, his later work consisted of images
containing black perpendicular lines and rectangles painted in primary colors on a white background.
He called this type of painting "Pure Neo-Plasticism" and the goal of his paintings was to
compose these essential elements so that these opposites of color and form would exist in equilibrium.

It looks easy to create these compositions, but it is not!

I have learned through experience that changing one of his paintings - his Composition With Red, Blue, and Yellow,
for example - even slightly destroys the image’s equilibrium.
For proof, see the gallery of experimental “Mondrianesque Compositions” at seeourminds.com.

The evolution in his paintings is interesting, but his writings - which explain his
perceptions and reasons for painting like this, are fascinating.

## The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships

Mondrian completed his final book
[The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Art-Life-Collected-Twentieth-Century/dp/0306805081)
in 1931, but by then had been working on it since at least 1921.
That may not quite be 100 years ago, but it's close enough.

In this book he claims that just as art has evolved into a composition containing opposites of form and color in equilibrium,
so will future society.
Following is a quote from the book's Introduction, written by Mondrian in 1932:

> The culture of art demonstrates that only *man's development* in the distant future can create universal equilibrium through the *establishment of equivalent relationships.* These relationships are already realized in pure art - art free from figuration and all limiting form - expressing the beauty of equivalent relationships exclusively through pure line and color.  This art is an image of the ideal human goal toward which humanity is moving.

Are we here today any closer to the goal of living in universal equilibrium than Mondrian was 100 years ago?
Join me in taking a look at some more quotes from this book and see if we can answer that question!
