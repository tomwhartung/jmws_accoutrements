 Conversions and Measureable Outcomes
======================================
Conversions are measurable, but we need to define precisely what they are
so that we can create the marketing tags needed to measure them.

Measureable Outcomes
--------------------
Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager make it possible to measure
what users do at these sites, but we must define precisely what user
actions we want to measure.
