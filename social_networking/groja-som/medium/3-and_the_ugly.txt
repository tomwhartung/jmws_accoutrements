The Ugly:
---------
I want to help people - myself included - see past the surface.

This is an image of Sandor "The Hound" Clegane's personality.  The Yellow shows he is realistic and open to new experiences, and the Green shows he is rational.

To learn more about how this image represents his personality, see his spiritual portrait at SeeOurMinds.com.

One Ugly thing is, some people steadfastly refuse to see past the surface.  They focus on others' superficial qualities, such as gender, age, race, religion, height, weight, etc.

Another Ugly thing is, down-to-earth, pragmatic, closed-minded people may find this desire of mine to see past the surface to be arrogant.  These pragmatic types outnumber idealists like me by almost 3 to 1.

And the really Ugly thing is, some people use superficial traits to create divisions between people and even foment hatred between superficially dissimilar groups.  This increases my feeling of urgency.

It follows that some people will undoubtedly feel offended by my desire to see past the surface — past the qualities that fuel their hatred — past this hatred that is more important to some than life itself.

I can see no way to escape the wrath of the trolls.

The Horror
----------
It's getting to the point where a person can't express any opinion online without someone pushing back.

Moreover, I believe that some people feel a subconscious need to insult others and their work to compensate for some perceived lack in themselves.

Yes people like this do exist.  They have smart phones but no interest in being smart, being only interested in putting themselves above others in any way they can.

In other words, some people refuse to acknowledge the reality of Kandinsky's Triangle, much less participate in the movement of it toward it's ultimate destination.

Bottom Line:
------------
"I don't care about the shape I'm in, I can't sing I ain't pretty and my legs are thin.
Don't ask me what I think of you, I might not give the answer that you want me to."

I am addressing this negativity and hostility only once - and this is it.  And I am doing this pre-emptively, so I won't have to waste any more time on closed-minded dumbasses who refuse to make the effort required to "get it."

Getting off on Tangents:
------------------------
If there's something you don't like about it, here's an accurate assessment of <a ... my feelings on the matter</a>

Perhaps even their failure to think about seeing past it before finding one of my spiritual portraits online.
Down-to-earth, pragmatic, closed-minded people thought the Beatles were arrogant, and burned their albums in the mid-1960s.
And who got the last laugh there (hahaha-hehehe-hohoho [link to I Am the Walrus])?
Ultimately, one way or the other, it's a new spin on an age-old trope: one perceived insult leads to a counter attack,
  soon both parties spiral into a bottomless pit of complete negativity.
As an idealist, I try my best to refrain from that sort of senseless behavior, and
  it's a complete waste of my time to try to educate a complete stranger who has no desire to learn.
