For adding apache2 mod_wsgi, to support django:
  This is the first django site on my server, so I want to be sure I keep a record of how I do my due diligence.
  djangoproject.com recommends downloading, building, and installing the latest version:
  - Use these for formulating the process we use, in 1-process_checklist-jane.txt .
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/checklist/
    - From comments in the generated settings.py file
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/
    - A version of the previous page specific to the version we are using
    https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/
    - Home page for mod_wsgi
    https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installation.html
    - Installation instructions for mod_wsgi
  There are some sites that suggest simpler procedures, but I believe "the hard way" is better
  - Use these for comparison and possible trouble-shooting.
    https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-django-applications-with-apache-and-mod_wsgi-on-ubuntu-16-04
    - uses apt-get to install mod_wsgi (bad) but sets up virtualenv and all (good)
    https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=Ubuntu_16.04&p=httpd&f=17
    - looks unsuited to a server using virtual hosts but has some details about how to configure apache
    https://www.linode.com/docs/websites/frameworks/django-apache-and-modwsgi-on-centos-5
    - Over five years old (2011-08-22) but has some details about how to configure apache
