If I want to collect email addresses, and be more professional, and cover my butt better,
I need to state my Terms of Service.

Yikes (I could get sued) and hmm (more stuff to learn about) and ugh (legalese, ugh).

## Requirements

- The Terms of Service (ToS) must be general yet specific enough to use on any of my sites
- The ToS should allow for:
  - Displaying AdSense ads
  - Selling (or giving away) images
  - Affiliate marketing
  - Building a list of fans' email addresses
  - Ask for donations

## References

- Picking a few from this page: https://digital.com/blog/best-privacy-policy-generators/
- WikiHow page: https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Terms-and-Conditions-and-Privacy-Policies-for-a-Business
  - From Part 1, Step 3: "All companies selling products will need to include a return, refund and loss provision."

### Informative Pages

These explain why I should have both the PP and the ToS and how to ensure users are aware of them.

More specific articles - these are all fairly long (and already appear in the list in 2-privacy_policy.md ):

- CA Online Privacy Protection Act: https://termsfeed.com/blog/caloppa/
- History of legislation in the EU: https://termsfeed.com/blog/eu-privacy-policy/
- The EU cookies directive: https://termsfeed.com/blog/eu-cookies-directive/
- About the latest EU legislation:
  - General info: https://termsfeed.com/blog/gdpr/
  - Creating the notice: https://termsfeed.com/blog/gdpr-notice/

## Process

1. Try a bunch of the generators
2. Pick the best and closest one to start with
3. Add in any updates needed from the other ones
4. Customize further if needed

### Sites to Use:

Doing this first batch made me decide to do more:

1. Simple, try first - #10 on list:
  - https://getterms.io/
2. Popular in search results - #6 on list:
  - https://www.iubenda.com/
3. Site has good articles about PP and ToS - #3 on list:
  - https://termsfeed.com/

After doing those, decided to review the list again and try a few more:

4. #1 on list - run by same people who created the list
  - https://privacypolicies.com/
5. #4 on list - being on a strict budget, I like the idea of it being free
  - https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/
6. #5 on list - covers Commission Junction and AdSense
  - http://www.privacypolicyonline.com/
7. Not on list - found in another search
  - https://www.volusion.com/v2/tools/privacy-policy
8. Not on list - found in another search
  - https://termly.io/privacy-policy/privacy-policy-generator/

## 1 - Simple, First Try: https://getterms.io/

- Generated terms along with the privacy policy (see the file with those notes)
- Tried creating policy and terms using the "blog" option, but got only terms (no policy)

## 2 - Get a Second Opinion: https://www.iubenda.com/

- No option to generate terms

## 3 - Third Version From the Site With the Nice Blog: https://termsfeed.com/

- Using tomwhartung.com
  - Choosing individual option, business option costs $7
- Forms are fairly similar to those used for the privacy policy
- Choosing the DON'T sell products option, selling products costs $9
- Choosing to NOT make it clear I own the content, that costs $12
- Choosing to NOT limit the liability, using "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," that costs $12
- Downloaded it all four formats:
  - `3-terms_of_service-3-termsfeed_com.docx`
  - `3-terms_of_service-3-termsfeed_com.html`
  - `3-terms_of_service-3-termsfeed_com.pdf`
  - `3-terms_of_service-3-termsfeed_com.txt`
- Their privacy policy: https://termsfeed.com/legal/privacy-policy
  - Might make a good outline for the final product
- Their terms of use: https://termsfeed.com/legal/terms-of-use
- Their disclaimer: https://termsfeed.com/legal/disclaimer
  - Something similar to this would be good to have for the quiz

## 4 - First on List Is Run by Same People Who Created the List: https://privacypolicies.com/

- There is no option to create a terms page at privacypolicies.com
  - Theirs may serve as a good example, though: https://privacypolicies.com/legal/terms-and-conditions

## 5 - Covers Commission Junction and AdSense: http://www.privacypolicyonline.com/

- Simple, single-page form, same as for the policy
  - Using www.seeourminds.com
  - Contact: webmaster@example.com
- Results:
  - `3-terms_of_service-5-privacypoliciesonline_com.html`
  - `3-terms_of_service-5-privacypoliciesonline_com.txt`
- Overall:
  - Judging by the options, and just glancing at the results, looks decent
  - Looks like the site originator is in a situation much like mine

## 6 - Liking the Idea of it Being Free: https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/

- There is NO option to create a terms page at freeprivacypolicy.com
- The site, and especially the results page, looks very much like what we saw at privacypolicies.com

## 7. Found in another search: https://www.volusion.com/v2/tools/privacy-policy

- Another very simple form:
  - JooMoo WebSites LLC
  - webmaster@example.com
- Results:
  - `3-terms_of_service-7-volusion_com.docx`
  - `3-terms_of_service-7-volusion_com.html`
  - `3-terms_of_service-7-volusion_com.txt`


## 8. Found in another search: https://termly.io/privacy-policy/privacy-policy-generator/

- Under pricing, they want $10/month to allow me to post it on my own site without their logo
  - https://app.termly.io/user/products
- Skipping this one, we should have enough, at least for now
- **May want to come back and check out some of the templates, though:**
  - https://termly.io/terms-and-conditions/sample-terms-and-conditions-templates-guide/
- **Note:** They also have templates for return policies, disclosures, and cookie policies

## Combined General Yet Specific Terms of Service
