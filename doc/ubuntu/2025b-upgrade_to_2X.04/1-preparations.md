Jane has a lot of stuff on there (e.g., my sites and React, etc.), so we don't want to do a fresh install


# Upgrade Jane

[ ] Upgrading to 22.04 should be straightforward and safe
[ ] Consider upgrading to 24.04
    - We can hold off on doing this for a year or two


# Preparations

[ ] Update `tarHome` to backup most relevant files for adding to new install
[ ] Run `tarHome` on all linux hosts
