 Getting Comfortable
=====================
Install the basic stuff we need to get around and do the other stuff.

This is the process we are running to set up jane.
--------------------------------------------------
Parts of it should be perfectly usable on other hosts.
Trying to make this more of a command line process, so we can identify
the essentials and get them set up, making getting other stuff done easier


Desktop Necessities for Comfortableness
---------------------------------------
[ ] Home Directory
   Restore home directory from backup, or take a copy from another host
[ ] Install any new updates
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
[ ] Install rcs, vim, subversion, openssh-server, git, git-svn, (??git-stuff, git-magic??)
    sudo apt-get install rcs vim subversion
    sudo apt-get install openssh-server
    sudo apt-get install git git-svn
[ ] Set up root account: .bashrc, links to .bash_aliases*
    As root:
      ln -s ~tomh/.bash_aliases .
      ln -s ~tomh/.bash_aliases-jane  .
      ln -s ~tomh/bin  .
      ln -s ~tomh/.vimrc   .
      vi .bashrc    ## Add cusTOMizations
      which ci
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l .bashrc
[ ] Update /etc/hosts and verify ssh is working
    Installing openssh-server seems to be enough to get it going
    As tomh:
      Remove or rename ~/.ssh/known-hosts
      Push over a copy of /etc/hosts
    As root:
      cd /etc
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l hosts fstab
      cat hosts
      more ~tomh/tmp/hosts
      mv ~tomh/tmp/hosts .
      vi hosts
      ci -l hosts
    Test using ssh to get from host to host.
[ ] Settings
    Go through list making initial adjustments:
    Appearance -> Background
    Brightness & Lock -> Turn all that shit off
    Network -> Setup static IP
    Power -> Adjust as necessary
    Software & Updates -> Updates -> Automatically check for updates -> Every week
    User Accounts -> Automatic Login (On)

[ ] Install xscreensaver-gl-extra
    apt-get install xscreensaver-gl-extra
[ ] Install unity-tweak-tool
    apt-get install unity-tweak-tool
[ ] Start and lock xscreensaver and unity-tweak-tool to launcher
    As tomh:
      which unity-tweak-tool
      unity-tweak-tool &
      which xscreensave-demor
      xscreensaver-demo &
[ ] Check man page for other steps needed to get it working at startup
    man xscreensaver
[ ] Remove gnome-screensaver
    As root:
      apt list gnome-screensaver
      apt-get remove gnome-screensaver
[ ] Add xscreensaver to startup programs
    As tomh:
      gnome-session-properties
    Window Manager -> Window Snapping -> turn all that shit off
[ ] Install synaptic and maybe some extra git packages
    sudo apt-get install synaptic
    (?? sudo apt-get install git-stuff git-magic ??)
[ ] Start and lock synaptic to launcher
    As root:
      synaptic
