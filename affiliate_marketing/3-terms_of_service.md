If I want to collect email addresses, and be more professional, and cover my butt better,
I need to state my Terms of Service.

Yikes (I could get sued) and hmm (more stuff to learn about) and ugh (legalese, ugh).

## Requirements

- The Terms of Service (ToS) must be general yet specific enough to use on any of my sites
- The ToS should allow for:
  - Displaying AdSense ads
  - Selling (or giving away) images
  - Affiliate marketing
  - Building a list of fans' email addresses
  - Ask for donations

  - From Part 1, Step 3: "All companies selling products will need to include a return, refund and loss provision."

### Informative Pages

These explain why I should have both the PP and the ToS and how to ensure users are aware of them.
