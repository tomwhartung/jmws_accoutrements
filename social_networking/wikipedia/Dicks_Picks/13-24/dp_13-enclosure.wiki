== Enclosure ==

Included with the release is a single sheet folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure that fits snugly inside the CD case. The front of this enclosure duplicates the cover of the CD, and the back is mostly black, with a white stripe across the bottom above a circular grey outline of a skull with the number 13 inside.

Inside the enclosure, the page on the left contains a single black-and-white photograph of the band on stage, taken looking down on them from an elevated position.  In the center at the top of the page on the right are the band's name, venue, date, and a list of the band's members.  Under this are two columns listing the tracks on the three CDs, credits for the CD, and copyright information in fine print at the bottom of the second column.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 13, 1999.</ref>
