# Factors Affecting the Costs

This text was originally on the Your Portrait page on groja.com .

I took it off of there because I want to keep that page as simple and clean as possible.

A bit of work went in to articulating all this, and we may want to use some or all of it
at some point in the future.

## Handmade Portraits

Although a large part of this process is automated by the
Groja Program &copy;, producing high-quality, unique and
personalized portraits takes time.

Add to that the possibility that I will want to
ensure customers understand and appreciate its significance
means that each image requires a personal touch.

Also, the program contains many options, such as different resolutions and
orientations (portrait vs. landscape) and even different compositions.

At this time, these options not currently demonstrated in the galleries.

If you are willing to work with me a bit, I can help you determine
what sort of image you like the most and
ensure it is within your price range before starting on it!

## Your Portrait

If the generic portrait of your four-letter type is not personalized enough for you, please
contact us to discuss what you might want and how much it will cost.

## How Much?

The cost of each Spiritual Portrait ranges from $0 to $1000, depending on how much work I have to put into making it.

If you know your four-letter type, check out the corresponding
image (called a generic portrait) in the Sixteen Types gallery page on
seeourminds.com .

Although it is not unique - and does not reflect the degree of your your personal preferences - technically it
is an image of your personality.
So feel free to download and enjoy it!

### Factors Affecting the Cost

Following is a list of some of the factors affecting the cost of your personalized Spiritual Portrait:

- Which version of the quiz you take
- How much time I have to spend explaining the process to you
- How much time I spend explaining the underlying theory, and its significance in our day-to-day lives, to you
- Whether you want any special customizations, such as:
  - Resolution
  - Aspect ratio
  - An experimental composition

I have absolutely no expectation that creating these will make me fabulously rich,
and I am certainly not looking to take advantage of anyone here.

However, I have put a lot of time &mdash; years, in fact &mdash; into coming up with this idea,
writing the various versions of the program, building and managing this site and its predecessors and
ultimately the (highly unnatural - for me, anyway) effort required to let people know that this service is available.

And of course after all that, there is the time spent creating a personalized image and
making sure it meets your satisfaction.

So I hope that if you are interested, you will contact us
and give us the opportunity to create a beautiful, unique, and
highly personal Spiritual Portrait - one that you can fully
appreciate and enjoy now and for years to come!
