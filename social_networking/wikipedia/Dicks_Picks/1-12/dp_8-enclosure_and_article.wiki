===Article===

The article was written by Richard Walinsky, is dated May 5, 1970, and is reprinted from the ''Colonial News SUNY Binghampton''.  The piece has a very excited tone and the author writes using a sort of [[stream-of-consciousness]] style.  He includes single-sentence paragraphs in all caps and uses incomplete sentences such as "Painted.  Tripping.  Stoned." and "Whoo.  Whoo.  Screams.  A Bird Call." to express his extremely [[Substance intoxication|high]] opinion of the show.

The author opens his piece by stating that the "concert was the finest in Harpur history, the finest the Dead have ever given on the East Coast to my knowledge.  And the finest concert I've ever seen...." About two-thirds of the way into the article Richard includes a section entitled "it's in the Kool-Aid" and asks a [[rhetorical question]]: "The hour grows late and the Dead is giving their best concert on the east coast and where?  At Harpur.  Here.  Binghampton dinktown USA and the Dead are amazing."

Walinsky closes his review by mentioning the last two songs of the show:

"Viola Lee Blues with three buildups, the last ending with people screaming and shouting and Garcia pulling the most phenomenal notes out of one guitar.  And We Bid You Goodnight, which they don't stop singing because no one will let them go.<br>
"But they do and the concert ends.<br>
"five and one half hours.<br>
"It's in the music."<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 8, &copy; 1997.</ref>
