 Goals
=======
It really helps to be clear about these, especially if I am going to be seeking advice from others.

Top Goals in Order of Importance
--------------------------------
1. Resilience
Long life, willing to do the work I love for most of it, even to the very end.

2. Money
We all need it, the more the better, BUT
Too much and the other goals will suffer. (*)

3. Long-term Engagement
Want to keep up-to-date with changes and trends, and continue working in some capacity.
I enjoy my work and always learning, and want to do both as long as I can.

4. Work-Life balance
It's either free-lancing or full-time, except for maybe a short while
o Doing both in the long run is not desireable
o Hence preference for short-term projects

5. Self-actualization - see 1-self-assessment .

(*) Balancing 2 and the Others Is Important
-------------------------------------------
Freelancing/self-employment can make that easier
  Spend part of the time using established skills for the money
  Spend art of the time: keeping up to date with changes and trends
