If I want to have a questionnaire and cover my butt, I should have a formal disclaimer.

## Requirements

- I forsee there being only one quiz, so it should be easy to keep it simple
- At this time the quiz is **on seeourminds.com only,** so we intend for this disclaimer to be posted only on that site

## References

Not finding much online.  The words disclaimer and disclosure are rather similar and yield similar search results.

This example is good, though, and should be enough:

- https://counsellingresource.com/quizzes/testing-disclaimer/

## Process

1. Find a good example
2. Look at what we have now
3. Combine these two sources
4. Adapt what we have to our current needs and concerns
