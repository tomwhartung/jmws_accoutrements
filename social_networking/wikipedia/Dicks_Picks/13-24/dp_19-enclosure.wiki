==Enclosure==

The release includes two sheets of paper stapled together in the middle, yielding an eight-page enclosure.  The front duplicates the cover of the CD and the back shows the outline of a white circular [[Steal Your Face|stealie]] superimposed on a color photograph of the [[prairie]] with a fence stretching out into the distance and a tornado forming in the sky above it.

The first two pages inside the enclosure feature a [[collage]] of memorabilia from the tour and the band's recent studio album [[Wake of the Flood]].  The middle two pages feature a [[photomontage]] of eight photos, three in color and five in black-and-white, of the band members performing on stage.  The [[penultimate]] page contains a single black-and-white photo of the band on stage backed by a color photo showing lightning bolts, and the last page lists the contents of and credits for the release.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 19, &copy; 1973, 2000.</ref>
