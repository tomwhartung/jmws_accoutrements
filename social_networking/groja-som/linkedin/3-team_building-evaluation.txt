==============================

Step 2: Evaluation
------------------
This step contains the following sub-steps:

(1) I present all images to the team
(2) We look for siloing and diversity
    Diversity 1: within one person (i.e., mild or slight preferences - colorful images)
    Siloing: a lot of the same types or similar-looking images
    Diversity 2: within a team (i.e., images that show all four colors are covered)
(3) Optional (but recommended): People look up information on the web about their type
    For quick infographics: this stuff is very popular on pinterest
    [Prediction: "T" types won't go for this.]
(4) Each team member displays their image in their work area
    Coffee mugs, note books, mouse pads, screen saver, etc.
    Remote teams could use their images as their avatar
    (or maybe have a website or something...?)

The time needed for each of these sub-steps depends on
- the size of the team and
- how willing team members are to cooperate.

I'd prefer to work with small teams, and insist on working with teams that are growing.
