Mom's Story
-----------
<p>My Mom got her undergraduate degree from <a href='https://wp.stolaf.edu/' title='St. Olaf College home page' target='_blank'>St. Olaf College</a>.  Around that time she met my father and they married in the early 1950s.
</p>

<p>After their marriage ended, she worked her way through Graduate School in Richmond, Virginia, and earned a Master's degree in Psychiatric Nursing.  She then started working at <a href='https://bonsecours.com/richmond/find-a-facility/st-marys-hospital' title='St. Mary's Hospital home page' target='_blank'>St. Mary's Hospital</a> as a Psychiatric Nurse.
</p>

<p>My parents' divorce was very acrimonious.  Eventually they cut off all communication with each other, completely and entirely.
Frustration with their <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkAlr90k23Y' title='Video of Teach Your Children on youtube.com' target='_blank'>behavior</a> during this time certainly led to my interest in psychology &mdash; and ultimately to the creation of this site.
</p>

<p>Since getting them to answer the questionnaire, I wonder sometimes whether the divorce may have had something to do with their personality types being so similar?  Certainly there were many factors at work with all this; moreover, it's best to try to just move on.
</p>

<p>My Mom remarried, and I was able to get my step-dad to take the quiz.  He turned out to be an ESTJ.
</p>

<p>She and my step-dad were happier together than my parents were.  Based on this, I am tempted to theorize that relationships work better when there's only one idealist (i.e., i<q>N</q>tuitive type).
</p>

<p>When I told my Mom that Dad came out as Extraverted, she laughed and exclaimed, <q>Your father is NOT Extraverted!</q>  It is obvious they had very serious communication problems!
</p>

<p>My take on this is that early in their relationship they had some shared ideals &mdash; or at least thought they did.  As time went on, amid the social turmoil and intellectual upheavals of the 1960s, either their ideals evolved along separate lines, or they found they did not share the same ideals in the first place.  More likely, it was a combination of both.
</p>

<p>Either way, they both found it easier to live with someone more pragmatic and down-to-earth.  Note that in the general population, <q>S</q>ensing-pragmatic-Yellow types <a href='http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/my-mbti-results/how-frequent-is-my-type.htm?bhcp=1' title='Page on myersbriggs.org showing the percentages of the various types in the general population' target='_blank'>outnumber</a> i<q>N</q>tuitive-idealistic-Blue types by close to 3-to-1, so both found solace in a more <q>normal</q> mate.
</p>

<p>Regardless, that is where I find closure in this ugly situation, and I'm sticking to it.  And gaining this sense of closure from Jung's, Briggs-Myers', and Keirsey's work is one of the things that drives me to share these ideas and this site with others.
</p>

<p>My Mom died in December of 2000.  Although I miss her, I have always felt it was good that she did not witness 9/11, because those sorts of things always affected her greatly.  Despite the fact her profile came out as more <q>T</q>hinking-logical-Green type, she could be quite emotional at times.
</p>

<p>It may sound strange, but I am glad to have this image to remember her by!

Dad's Story
-----------
<p>My Dad got his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill <a href='https://www.unc.edu/' title='Home page of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill' target='_blank'>(UNC)</a>.  Around this time he met my mother and they married in the early 1950s.
</p>

<p>While we lived in Richmond, Virginia, he worked for many years at <a href='http://www.texaco.com/' title='Home page of texaco.com' target='_blank'>Texaco</a> and then later at <a href='http://www.altria.com/our-companies/philipmorrisusa/Pages/default.aspx' title='Home page of Phillip Morris' target='_blank'>Phillip Morris</a> &mdash; in both jobs as a Research Chemist.
</p>

<p>My parents' divorce was very acrimonious.  Eventually they cut off all communication with each other, completely and entirely.
Frustration with their <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkAlr90k23Y' title='Video of Teach Your Children on youtube.com' target='_blank'>behavior</a> during this time certainly led to my interest in psychology &mdash; and ultimately to the creation of this site.
</p>

<p>Since getting them to answer the questionnaire, I wonder sometimes whether the divorce may have had something to do with their personality types being so similar?  Certainly there were many factors at work with all this; moreover, it's best to try to just move on.
</p>

<p>My Dad remarried, but my step-mom refused to take the quiz.  In all the years I have been doing this, I can't remember meeting anyone else who refused to answer the questionnaire.  I suspect she was an ESTJ or an ESFJ, but there's no way to know for sure.
</p>

<p>He and my step-mom were happier together than my parents were.  Based on this, I am tempted to theorize that relationships work better when there's only one idealist (i.e., i<q>N</q>tuitive type).

</p>

<p>My Dad and I have fallen out of touch over the years.  It may sound strange, but I am glad to have this image to remember him by!

My Story
--------
<p>Growing up in Richmond, Virginia in the 1960s meant watching assassinations, riots and a war on TV, listening to The Beatles and all the others, and watching too many musicians die of overdoses and the like.  We could drink 3.2 beer on our 18th birthday, whoo-hoo!
</p>

<p>With that youthful feeling of immortality combined with the impending doom of the Cold War hanging over our heads, it was a good time to smoke cigarettes.  In Richmond in those days, they were 25 cents a pack.  Also there were friends, beer and The Grateful Dead, and work and school.
</p>

<p>My Dad offered to help me with school, and I accepted it for the first year or so.  But by then they were divorcing and I decided to pay my own way through it.  My idealism certainly played a factor in this decision.
</p>

<p>My parents' divorce was very acrimonious.  Eventually they cut off all communication with each other, completely and entirely.  The divorce was one thing, but that sort of ongoing hostility really made things quite difficult.
</p>

<p>Of course, I focused on school, work, and having fun with friends.  And as far as <q>making lemonade</q> when given lemons is concerned, it's safe to say that frustration with their <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkAlr90k23Y' title='Video of Teach Your Children on youtube.com' target='_blank'>behavior</a> during this time certainly led to my interest in psychology &mdash; and ultimately to the creation of this site.
</p>

<p>Since getting them to answer the questionnaire, I wonder sometimes whether the divorce may have had something to do with their personality types being so similar?  Certainly there were many factors at work with all this; moreover, it's best to try to just move on.
</p>

<p>So I worked my way through school, sometimes at part-time jobs, and sometimes at full-time jobs.  During this time, I had full-time jobs at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Overnite-Transportation/163666416984656' title='Facebook page for Overnite Transportation' target='_blank'>Overnite Transportation</a>, <a href='http://www.richmondgov.com/' title='Home page of The City of Richmond VA' target='_blank'>The City of Richmond VA</a>, and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Virginia' title='Wikipedia page for The Bank of Virginia' target='_blank'>The Bank of Virginia</a>.
</p>

<p>Working every day, it took awhile, but eventually I earned my B.S. in Math (Computer Science) and a Masters of Interdisciplinary Studies from Virginia Commonwealth University <a href='https://www.vcu.edu/' title='Home page of Virginia Commonwealth University' target='_blank'>(VCU)</a>.
</p>

<p>After getting my B.S. in Math, I had to take <em>a lot</em> of additional courses in Art just to get accepted into the prestigious &mdash; at that time &mdash; Interdisciplinary program.  (VCU no longer offers that degree.)  Fortunately I love learning about Art and especially Art History!
</p>

<p>It wound up taking me seventeen years &mdash; from 1972 through 1989 &mdash; to finish the Masters Degree, but I had quit for four years (so it was really "only" thirteen years) and changed my major a few times.
</p>

<p>Moreover I did it <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDyb_alTkMQ' title='Official video of Sid Vicious doing My Way on youtube.com' target='_blank'>My Way,</a> and have no regrets &mdash; except maybe for the stupid tobacco habit.  Although I spent much of the time working, I loved going to school &mdash; and continue to love learning to this day!
</p>

<p>I eventually quit the ciggies in 2002, and only wish I'd quit sooner.  But that story is for another day.
