===================================
For important background information, see 0-the_good-the_bad-and_the_ugly-overview.txt in this directory.

Theme:
------
I like my new site.

Theme Song:
-----------
For Artists Only by Talking Heads

The Good Content:
-----------------
I want to help people - myself included - see past the surface.

The Good thing is, I have written a program to help me do this.
In effect, it's rather like a simple language that reveals a lot about an individual in a single glance.

Another Good thing is, it's a simple language: it uses primary colors to represent fundamental traits.

And yet another Good thing is, most if not all religions can agree that our bodies are just temporary shells for what makes us us.
I do not wish to favor any one religion over any others, but I do believe that our inner qualities are far more important
than the external.

Moreover, a person's superficial qualities has little bearing on what they actually do.
And what people do is far more important than how they look.

This Is My Art
--------------
I have studied music, drawing, painting, photography, film, and dance - but not all at the same time!
[Link to or mention or both the article about Kandinsky's triangle here.]

If anyone is qualified to say what is art and what is not art, it is me.

These spiritual portraits are art, and no one can change that.
[Link to song: Talking Heads - For Artists Only]

It expresses how I look at people; it's an expression of how I view our world.
In this respect, it's no different from any other art.

Bottom Line:
------------
Calling it "art" gives me artistic license.
Publishing more examples will help more people get it, but that takes time, a lot of time.

It's not all a bed of roses though.  For more, see the next article in this series.


Going off on Tangents:
----------------------
Some will pick up on the patterns more quickly than others.  Some will close themselves off to it completely right from the start.
Such is the movement of The Triangle.

I love to learn and in addition to learning numerous computer languages
I took my first ballet class when I was in my 40s.

I believe having enough examples will enable Artificially Intelligent programs to get it.
If you want to stay ahead of the machines, I recommend you invest some time understanding the idea behind these images.
