# Core Ideas

Ideas for addressing a want, pain, or fear - which is what Seth Godin suggests - in my first ebook:

- Death: yours and mine
  - You cannot answer the questions when you are dead
- Grojas: only way to really preserve your personality
  - You will never see your personality unless I do it before you die
- Fear: are you afraid of your own subconscious?

Planning to give it away.

- Idea for experiementation:
  - Give book away, sell the image
  - Sell the book for like $1 and have it include a coupon for a free image
  - Logistics?
  - Compare success of ideas?
  - How to have a coupon in an e-book?

This might be silly but think about it.

**Need to focus on content to start!**

## Unorganized Ideas

Either merge these ideas into one of the major sections below or don't use them

- Key Point: the images reflect the strength of the preferences
  - People with mild preferences are very different from those with strong preferences - and the images reflect that

- Explaining the core pairs of opposites
  - N vs. S - Perceptions
    - As different as night and day
    - The biggest differences between people
  - F vs. T - Motivations
    - Warm vs. Cool
    - The source of most difficulties between people

  - Strong preferences:
    - Meyers-Briggs warns repeatedly that a strong supporting function is essential

## My Theories

On the fence about including these ideas.

**It may be best to present these ideas in an article on medium.**

- My Theory 1
  - We tend to look for who we are in others
  - In my opinion, we tend to unconsciously project our tendencies preferences onto others
  - That is, we expect others to do what we would do - unless there is a reason not to, such as until we get to know someone better



## Selling Points

- Gain insight into recurring people problems
- Wake up - increase awareness of self and others
  - It's always nice to bring unconscious information to the surface
- All of us are expressing these traits in our daily actions
  - Take control - choose self-knowledge over floating through life like flotsam
  - Many of us are already subconsciously processing this information to varying degrees
  - All I am doing is making the invisible visible
- Strong preferences are visible immediately
    - For example: stubbornness and haplessness


## Major Sections

Go ahead and expand these now if desired, and just paste them into the outline later.

-
- How to Draw a Personality
  - Choose what qualities you want to portray
    - For example, Jungian, Big 5, something from the DSM, etc.
  - Find a questionnaire
    - Find an existing questionnaire that is OK to use, or write your own, or both
  - Decide how to represent the qualities
    - For example, what shapes and colors to use for these traits, what types vectors for those traits, etc.
  - Consider writing a program to do the work
    - Writing a program to convert the results to an image is **not** necessary, but it makes it easy to create consistent images
  - Obtain personality profiles and draw them!
    - Get people to answer the questionnaire

  - [TODO: Adapt this into an infographic - **or do portions of it or the whole thing as an infographic** - and post to pinterst]

- Introduce what each of the colors represents
  - Maybe as part of the How-to?


- Are You Someone Who Will Appreciate Their Spiritual Portrait?
  - World's Shortest Personality Quiz - or Something
    - Instant Personality Quiz?
    - Two questions, pick where you are on the continuum
      - Use at least positive, neutral, and negative synonym on each side
      - Use the colors subtlely in the continuum - a gradient with white in the middle might be nice
      - S ------- N - where are you, on a scale of 1-10?
      - T ------- F - where are you, on a scale of 1-10?
    - What your score means:
      - If your score is 10 or more, you will like your spiritual portrait
        - The higher your score, the better chance you will like it
      - If your score is less than 10, a spiritual portrait is not for you
        - The lower your score, the less probability you will like it
   - How it works
     - Personality traits and images of personalities are abstract
       - If you are more N than S,
       - If you are more Blue than Yellow,
       - If you prefer ideas to facts,
       - If you are more comfortable with abstractions than most,
       - Then you will understand the images more easily
     - Personality traits and images of personalities are all about people
       - If you are more F than T,
       - If you are more Red than Green,
       - If you prefer emotions to logic,
       - If you'd rather work with people than things,
       - Then you will understand the images more easily
