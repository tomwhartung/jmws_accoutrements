 Target Market and Services to Offer
=====================================
Ideas that have been rolling around in my head for the past few weeks/months/years even

Targeting
---------
o Startups
o Small businesses

Services
--------
Currently feel qualified to offer:
o General free-lancing: LAMP, CMS, Java
  No project to small (smaller projects preferred)
o Device Detection in LAMP CMSes (e.g., targeting ads)
o De-mystify technology and jargon
o CMS selection
o Training
Would like to be able to offer: (apply for business loan for initial funding??)
o Research IoT Ideas
o Simple watch apps (e.g., background)
  Think this would be easy, but
  Would need some sort of loan to buy watch(es?)

Freemium Offers
---------------
o Free: 1 hour meeting to discuss your situation
o E-books ...

My Startup Idea(s)
