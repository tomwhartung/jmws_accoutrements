The release includes three sheets of paper stapled together in the middle, yielding a twelve-page enclosure.  The front duplicates the cover of the CD and the back is a mostly blank, textured grey that matches the background of the front.

The first two pages inside the front cover contain a [[collage]] consisting of a Dead Heads Newsletter and a clipping of a short newspaper article.  The next two pages are a [[photomontage]] of black-and-white photographs of each of the band's members, and the middle two pages feature a large black-and-white photograph of the band playing on stage.  The next two pages contain another photomontage of black-and-white photographs of each of the band's members, and the last two pages list the contents of and credits for the release.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 28, &copy; 1973, 2003.</ref>
