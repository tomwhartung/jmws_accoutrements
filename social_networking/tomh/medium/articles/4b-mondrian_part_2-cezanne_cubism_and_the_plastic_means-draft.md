Time to take the basic ideas I have for this new article on medium and turn them into a draft.

**Try to keep it short and sweet -- and focused on Mondrian's use of the term "plastic."**

LOL as if!  But try!!

## [Introduction -- implied rather than stated]

This is part 2 of a series of articles about the work of the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian, 1872-1944.
For part 1 see [The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian, Part 1: Equilibrium in Art and Life](https://medium.com/@tomwhartung/the-prophetic-vision-of-piet-mondrian-part-1-equilibrium-in-art-and-life-c2b7ba006fd5)

The image above is a poster of a painting Mondrian completed in 1922 entitled *Composition 2.*
It is typical of Mondrian's distinctive style, which he called *Neo-Plasticism* or *The New Plastic.*

You can buy a poster of images like this from the site [art.com](https://www.art.com/gallery/id--a7/piet-mondrian-posters.htm) for around $100 to $200,
or find originals similar to it on the site [sothebys.com](https://www.sothebys.com/en/artists/piet-mondrian) for around $2,000,000 to over $30,000,000.

The fact that Mondrian's paintings now sell for amounts that most of us will never be able to afford is proof that his vision was truly prophetic.
In trying to understand his art, I've spent a considerable amount of time reading his *Collected Writings,* which are quite challenging to read.

And although Mondrian's work is valuable today, he lived humbly.
According to the Chronology in his *Collected Writings,* times had to supplement "his small income by painting watercolors of flowers" [1922, p. xxii].

Also in his *Collected Writings* is this quote, from a letter he wrote to Arnold Saalborn around 1910:

> But since I do not earn much with "my kind of work," I also have to devote a great deal of time to work for the mass, that is,
> a more conventional manner of painting -- so I have to work twice as much [p. 19].

In this article I focus on how I eventually learned what Piet Mondrian means by the word *plastic,* because that is essential to understanding Mondrian's writings.

## Piet Mondrian's *Collected Writings*

*The New Art -- The New Life, The Collected Writings of Piet Mondrian,* is a book edited and translated by Henry Holtzman and Martin S. James first published in 1986.
Holtzman and James divide their book into three parts, and in it Mondrian's writings appear in chronological order.

Part I, *The De Stijl Years: 1917-24,* covers his writings for the journal *De Stijl.*
Part II, *After De Stijl: 1924-1938,* contains the pieces he wrote while still in continental Europe, after he and *De Stijl* parted ways.
And Part III, *England and the United States: 1938-1944,* includes the articles and essays he wrote after leaving continental Europe due to the impending war.

One of the pieces in this book is *The New Art -- The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships,* which Mondrian first completed in December, 1931.
It appears in Part II of the book and is one of Mondrian's most enlightening works, because it draws parallels between his art and society at large, which explains its use in the title of his *Collected Writings.*

In a letter dated August 6, 1931 he called the piece a "little work into which I have compressed all that I believe and hope for" [p. 245].
And in this "little work" he discusses "equivalent relationships" [e.g., p. 248, p. 251], "individual liberty" and "independent existence" [p. 255], and ultimately "high universal morality -- the true content of love, friendship, brotherhood, and all their synonyms" [p. 271].

In the past I've checked out copies of this book from the library, and read the articles and essays somewhat randomly, picking out those with the most interesting-sounding titles.
Recently I obtained my very own copy of this book, and decided to take a more methodical approach, starting with read the introductory material by the editors and reading the articles in chronological order.

## Plastic Means Versus Plastic Material

Throughout his writings Mondrian frequently uses the term "plastic."
As mentioned above, he refers to the style of his work as the "New Plastic" or "Neo-Plasticism," and this term appears in the title of many of his articles.

In fact, Mondrian called his first book -- which was published as a collection of essays in *De Stijl* -- *The New Plastic in Painting.*
He began writing it in 1914, and it appeared in twelve installments in the first issues of the journal *De Stijl,* between October 1917 and October 1918.

While reading his collected writings, I have found the term "plastic" to be a constant mental stumbling block.
It is clear from the context that when Mondrian uses the word he is not referring to the ubiquitous plastic material used to make many of today's products.

Context makes it somewhat clear that he uses the word "plastic" to refer to the way he constructs and composes his images -- the way he molds reality into shapes of his own choosing.
For example, one of the chapters in the *New Plastic in Painting* series of articles is entitled *The New Plastic as Abstract-Real Painting: Plastic Means and Composition.*

## Plastic This, Plastic That

In the first twelve paragraphs of his "little work" *The New Art -- The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships,* Mondrian uses the term fifteen times.
The word appears with a qualifier in each of these occurrences:

- "plastic means" occurs 7 times
- "plastic expression" occurs 5 times
- "plastic value" occurs 3 times

For example, He uses the word with all three of these qualifiers in the eighth paragraph:

> But the new art differs from the art of the past also from the viewpoint of relationships.
> If purely plastic expression is created by "the relationships" of line, plane surface, and color in their purely plastic values, then these means *exist only through their relationships.*
> Therefore, relationships are just as important as the plastic means.  [p. 246, emphasis in original].

One of the reasons I decided to read his writings in chronological sequence is that I was hoping to find a definition of the term, or at least learn to be more comfortable with it when I encountered it.
Naturally, if one wants to learn something, it makes sense to start at the beginning.

Unfortunately, he never really defines the term, and although I had a hunch, I was never really 100% sure what he meant by the it.
Although I had a sense of what he meant, it would be impossible for me to explain it to somene with confidence.

As I went through his articles and essays, it became clear that I needed to back up to and learn about the artists who inspired Mondrian: Paul Cézanne and the Cubists.

## Cubism

In their introductory pieces, the editors and translators of the *Collected Writings* discuss how Cubism influenced Mondrian's early work.

In his essay *Piet Mondrian: The Man and His Work,* Harry Holtzman writes:

> Mondrian saw Cubism as the new awareness of the intrinsic means of plastic expression, as the destruction of the naturalistic and the mimetic, as the conscious
> construction of the picure-plane, as the dynamic rhythm of its composition of forms in space.  [p. 8.]

In his essay *Piet Mondrian: Art and Theory to 1917,* Martin S. James writes:

> Cubism, Mondrian repeatedly stressed, opened the way for the New Plastic.  Shortly after seeing examples of early Cubist work by Picasso and Braque at the Monderne
> Kunstkring in late 1911, he settled in Paris.  His analytical Cubist "compositions" of 1912-13 in grays and browns were based on a favorite motif, the tree, where
> particular forms disappear almost completely in the whole.  [p. 14.]

As I continued reading Mondrian's *Collected Works,* he continued to use the word "plastic," and would occasionally refer to Cubism.
I never really understood Cubism either, so at one point I put Mondrian's book aside and started reading Douglas Cooper's book *The Cubist Epoch,* published in 1971.

## My Interest in All This

As I learned about Cubism, I started thinking that it would be a great style to adopt for the next phase of my own Art project, which entails visualizing personalities.
Mondrian's work -- which is based on opposites of color and form -- served as a major inspiration for the first phase of this project, which depicts the opposites Carl Jung describes in his
*General Description of the Types.*

Isabel Briggs-Myers codified Jung's work and created the Myers Briggs Type Indicator or [MBTI (r)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator), which people can use to find their four-letter type.
I am proud to be an INFP!
Courses and books explaining these four-letter types are popular, and posts referencing them are easy to find on social media sites like twitter, pinterest, reddit, and tumblr.

Recently I decided to base the next phase of this project on the Big Five "OCEAN" personality traits, and have been researching those in parallel with my studies of Art history.
Learning about and looking at how the various Cubist artists and their paintings evolved over time, I started thinking this style -- which is more nuanced than Mondrian's work --
would be a great way to express these personality traits, which are more nuanced than Jung's personality types.

So taking this detour into understanding Cubism has been inspiring!

## Cézanne

As I became increasingly interested in and inspired by the Cubists, I learned that these artists and their work were in turn inspired by Paul Cézanne's paintings.
Indeed, *The Cubist Epoch* mentions him with about the same frequency as Mondrian mentions the "plastic means!"

After reading a few chapters of *The Cubist Epoch* I eventually caved in to this curiosity, and searched for books about Cézanne in the Denver Public Library.
This was during the Coronovirus pandemic in 2020, so I had to put the seven books I found on hold and arrange to pick them via their curbside holds service.

These books are large and printed on high-quality paper, so they're very heavy.
When I went to pick them up it took two people to carry them all out to my car!

It was in one of these books that I finally learned exactly what Mondrian meant by the term "Plastic Means."

## The Plastic Means

Most of the books about Cézanne that I found were either biographical in nature, or used critiques to expound on his place in Art history, or both.

One of the books, *Cézanne's Composition: Analysis of His Form With Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs* by Erle Loran, did not fit into this mold.
And it was in this book, published in 1943, that I finally found a formal definition of "The Plastic Means."

To say that I was excited is a bit of an understatement!

Loran's book is divided into sections rather than chapters, and Section III, of a total of XV, is named *An Illustrated Glossary.*
One typically finds a glossary of terms near the end of a book, but Loran's definitions come near the beginning of his book, on page 17 of a total of 136.

Although it spans a mere 8 pages, Loran's *Illustrated Glossary* contains 22 diagrams, and it defines this term early on.
Although they are just sketches in black-and-white, these diagrams are invaluable for someone wanting to understand the terms he uses in the remainder of the book.

It turns out that, although my guess regarding the meaning of the term "Plastic Means" as being the *compositon of a painting* was fuzzy, I was pretty close!

- Source: Cézanne's Composition by Erle Loran, p. 17.

In the glossary for his book, Loran calls this image "Diagram II" and he uses it to define the terms *negative space* and *the plastic means or plastic form.*
It shows a sketch of the subject matter for Cézannes 1987 painting *House and Farm at Jas de Bouffan* in an imaginary three-dimensional picture box.

![`../images/mondrian_part_2-cezanne-house_and_farm_at_jas_de_bouffan-1887.jpg`](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_accoutrements/blob/master/social_networking/tomh/medium/images/mondrian_part_2-cezanne-house_and_farm_at_jas_de_bouffan-1887.jpg)

- Source: https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/house-and-farm-at-jas-de-bouffan-1887

Given this sketch and Cézanne's rendering of the motif, we can see that the *plastic means* is essentially the way a painter interprets or projects three-dimensional subject matter onto the two dimensions of the picture plane.


-------- So far, so good. -------

Most significantly, this book compares Cézanne's paintings with photographs of his motifs.

These comparisons are incredibly valuable for those seeking to understand why Cézanne is considered the father of Modern Art.

## Conclusion

It's difficult to find a definition of the word "plastic" that corresponds to Mondrian's use of the word.

Indeed, the index to the book Vision in Motion by L. Moholy-Nagy (1961) lists 19 occurrences of the term, but only the first mimics Mondrian's use of the term, while the other 18 references are to the material.

If you are interested in the language of composition in general, and in reading Mondrian's writings in particular, I highly recommend finding a copy of Erle Loran's book!
