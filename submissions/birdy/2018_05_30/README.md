Birdy submissions.

Post any of these that Birdy doesn't want online, probably medium would be best.
Then post links to the article on social networking sites.

Actually, check with Birdy to see if posting them online, and plugging their magazine in an intro to the article, is ok.

# Checklist

Check these off when they are done.
Word counts are for the article ONLY, and do not include the titles or footnotes, just the article.

## Key to the Checklist:

- [X] - Upper case "X" - Done, but worth re-reading before submitting
- [x] - Lower case "x" - Complete, but definitely requires review before submitting
- [-] - Dash - Article has at least a solid start, it's an expanded outline or close to complete, or at best may need only a nice ending
- [ ] - Blank - Images, titles, and boiler plate are done **before** adding the article to the checklist
