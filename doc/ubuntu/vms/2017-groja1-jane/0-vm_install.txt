These are similar to the ones we used in 3-experimenting_with_extras.txt .

On Linux System, Before Installing a New VM:
--------------------------------------------
[ ] Set up bridged networking
[ ] Install KVM and dependencies
    See doc/ubuntu/specific_hosts/2016-bette/3-experimenting_with_extras.txt

1. Install Ubuntu 16.04 LAMP Server:
------------------------------------
[ ] Start the Virtual Machine Manager
    Use the "Search your computer" Ubuntu icon to find it
[ ] Create a new VM
    Click on first icon (screen + flashlight)
    Local install media (CDROM) -> Forward
    Use CDROM or DVD -> Forward
    Memory: 1024M (*); CPUs (Up to 4 available): 1 -> Forward
      These are the default values
      (*) Using less than 1G on ava
    Enable storage - Create a disk image: 20G -> Forward
      20G is the default value
      209G available in the default location (/var/lib/libvirt/images/)

      The linuxconfig reference says the last screen has an option to select bridged networking
        It says it should be selected by default
      I did not notice this but a screenshot in the linuxbabe.com reference shows a
        dropdown widget allowing us to set "Advanced options"
    --> Next time, open this up to see what options are there.
    Creating the image...
