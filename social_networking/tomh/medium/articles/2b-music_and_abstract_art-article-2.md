# Music, Meaning, and Modern Art: Part 2 of 3

This is part two of a three part series of articles written for people who love music but do not understand abstract art.

[Part one]() features Bob Dylan's song All Along the Watchtower and [part three]() features the Talking Heads' first four albums.

All three articles reference highly-acclaimed works of music and visual art that have stood the test of time.
The articles use these well-known works to help explain how musicians and painters use abstractions to add value and meaning to their work.

Depending on your interest level, you can read one, two, or all three of these articles.
All of them are about essentially the same thing, but each can stand on its own, so you can read them in any sequence you desire.

Sound complicated? It isn’t! All it takes is a little imagination.

## Exercising Your Imagination

Look at Kandinsky’s woodcut of Two Birds (1907) above and:

1. Listen to [this version by Paul McCartney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swUlDc3v3DE) - or
   if you're already familiar with the song, just imagine you are listening to Blackbird by The Beatles
2. Rather than being about a bird, imagine the song is about African Americans
3. Rather than representing actual birds, imagine the birds in the woodcut represent two people, or
   two groups of people, one African and the other European

Easy enough, right? Ok, now we’re ready!

## Jazz Can Be More Abstract

Jazz, especially when it's instrumental and doesn't have lyrics, can be much more abstract than most folk, rock, and folk-rock.

Take, for example, some of the music by John Coltrane.

#### John Coltrane - Alabama

John Coltrane - "Trane" - wrote the song
[Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_(John_Coltrane_song))
in 1963.

Although he wrote it in response to the
[bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Street_Baptist_Church_bombing),
in
[Birmingham, Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama),
today there is no way to tell that from the song itself.
Indeed, today it is difficult to even imagine
[people doing such a thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-MuWDsv5pg).

This act of white supremist terrorism killed four girls and injured twenty-two others.

At the time, everyone knew this was Trane's motivation for writing the song.
[Listening to it now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saN1BwlxJxA), however,
you might think its theme is similar to that of the song
[Georgia on My Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glggureA_Kk)
by Ray Charles.
Nothing could be further from the truth!

- Compare to Blackbird by The Beatles

#### John Coltrane - A Love Supreme

The passion Coltrane felt for the
[African-American civil rights movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1954%E2%80%931968))
surfaces fully a couple of years later, in his magnum opus,
[A Love Supreme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Love_Supreme).

The album is very spiritual and contains four songs or "parts:" 1. Acknowledgement, 2. Resolution, 3. Pursuance, and 4. Psalm.
You can listen to
[the whole thing on youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll3CMgiUPuU).

Others have written about this masterpiece much more elegantly than I ever could.
One
[article at nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/23/arts/music-coltrane-at-75-the-man-and-the-myths.html)
reviews it in the context of Trane's life and other works, and
[another at wbur.org](http://www.wbur.org/artery/2014/10/10/coltrane-love-supreme-50)
describes why it is still relevant after fifty years.

In my mind, Miles Davis provides the best perspective on Trane's magnum opus.

#### Miles Davis - On Trane, A Love Supreme, and Civil Rights

I first learned the significance of what John Coltrane was saying in A Love Supreme when I read about it in Miles Davis' autobiography.

[Here is the whole thing, from pp. 285-286 of his Autobiography, written with Quincy Troupe and published in 1989.]

```
Trane's music and what he was playing during the last two or three years [1965-1967]
of his life represented, for many blacks, the fire and passion and rage and anger and rebellion and love that they felt,
especially among the young black intellectuals and revolutionaries of that time.
He was expressing through music what H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael and the Black Panthers and Huey Newton
were saying with their words, what the Last Poets and Amiri Baraka were saying in poetry.
He was their torchbearer in jazz, now ahead of me.
He played what they felt inside and were expressing through riots - "burn baby burn" - that
were taking place everywhere in this country during the 1960s.
It was all about revolution for a lot of young black people -
Afro haircuts, dashikis, black power, fists raised in the air.
Coltrane was their symbol, their pride - their beautiful, black, revolutionary pride.
I had been it a few years back, now he was it, and that was cool with me.
```
[Separate paragraph.]
```
It was this way for many intellectual and revolutionary whites and Asians as well.
Even his change to a more spiritual music in the music on A Love Supreme - which was like a prayer - reached
out and influenced those people who were into peace, hippies and people like that.
```
[Using only the above, but here is the rest of that paragraph, for possible future reference.]
```
I heard he played a lot of love-ins, which was becoming the rage all over California for a lot of whites.
So he was reaching different groups of people, too.
His music was embraced by a lot of different kinds of people, and that was beautiful and I was proud of him,
even if I liked his earlier music more.
He once told me that even he liked some of the music he did earlier better than what he was doing now.
But Trane was on a search, and his course kept taking him farther and farther out; he couldn't turn back even though I think he wanted to.
```
[Separate paragraph - unused - too sad!]
```
His death created chaos in the "free thing" because he was its leader.
He was like Bird to all those musicians who considered themselves "out" - you, know, "free," out in space:
he was like a god to them.
When he died it was much like when Bird died for a lot of bebop musicans who looked to him for directions,
even though he himself had been directionless for a lot of years.
Ornette Coleman was still around, and some turned to him.
But for most Trane had been their guiding light, and after he was gone they seemed to me like people in a
boat in the ocean without compass or paddles.
It seemed a lot of what he stood for musically died with him.
Even though some of his disciples carried on his message, they carried it to smaller and smaller audiences.
```

After reading this, I bought Trane’s album right away!

#### BYOM: Filling in Coltrane's Blanks

Truly appreciating A Love Supreme requires a knowledge of some American history.
The web and your local library provide access to a lot of this information, totally for free.

For example, watching at least one of these civil rights documentaries from the mid-1960s is a good start:

- [History of the Civil Rights Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxwe6LPvkM) (5:52)
- [Alabama City Remembered as Climactic Battle of Civil Rights Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggUt0gJh9U8) (4:27)
- [Burmingham 1983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0lD37bq8YI) (4:22)

Also, listening to at least part of at least one of these speeches by
[Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.)
from that period can provide additional valuable context:

- [I Have a Dream - August 28, 1963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UV1fs8lAbg) (17:28)
- [Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Speech - December 19, 1964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r98tT0j1a0) (12:01)
- [Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence - April 4, 1967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qf6x9_MLD0) (53:46)

The more you learn about race relations in America during the early-to-mid-1960s, the more you will be able to appreciate John Coltrane’s music.

## Visualizing Racism: The Americans and Heretic

What does racism look like? A couple of works - one each in Modern Photography and Modern Dance - can answer that question quite well.

Image: images/Robert_Frank-1958-The_Americans-cover.jpg
Title and Attribution: Cover of The Americans - By Robert Frank, 1958. Fair use.
Link: https://www.amazon.com/Americans-Robert-Frank/dp/386521584X

The cover of [Robert Frank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frank)'s ground-breaking and innovative book of photographs,
[The Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans_(photography)) (1958), offers a powerful and unforgettable portrait of racism.

This image shows a trolley car in [New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans) in which people must obey the
[Jim Crow laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws) in force throughout the
[Southern United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States) from the 1870s through the 1950s.
Ostensibly intended to enforce
"[separate but equal](https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/civil-war-reconstruction/jim-crow-laws-andracial-segregation/)"
treatment of the races after the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War),
in practice the laws were used to make African Americans second-class citizens.

It is well worth your while to
[search for the image](https://www.google.com/search?q=cover+of+the+americans+by+robert+frank&tbm=isch)
and select a high-resolution copy of it so you can see "up close" the stark contrast between the smug expression of the woman
near the front with the more matter-of-fact expression of the man behind her near the back.
It is actually these facial expressions that give this photograph such a strong, memorable realism, but it is difficult to
see them in low-resolution images such as the one on this page.

```

Robert Frank’s photograph is of necessity limited by time and place, and it stands in stark contrast with the similarly-themed ballet
[Heretic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgscJaDUM9w) (1929) choreographed by [Martha Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Graham)
and performed by her - wearing the white dress, with her hair down, and in the lead role - along with
[her dance company](http://www.marthagraham.org/).

On the surface, Martha Graham's ballet has nothing at all to do with racism.  Its message is much more abstract.

An astute viewer would quickly perceive that there are no men, no children, no non-whites, no elderly, and no overweight people in
this dance company.
A [pedantic](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pedantic) individual would be justified in claiming Martha's dance company
practices the same type of exclusionary principles the choreographer apparently - and presumably - implicitly disdains in this dance.

Also, with its basis in the word [heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy), the title implies that the outcast has a choice in the matter -
which is certainly not the case when it comes to skin color.
These factors do not by any means limit the relevance or impact of, or the power present in, this work of art.

It is certainly reasonable to expect a group of people such as
[Susan Fowler](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber),
[Edward Snowden](https://www.seeourminds.com/image/0500-real-famous/0504/),
[Rosa Parks](http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/rosa-parks),
and anyone who has ever been [laid off from a job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff),
with their disparate experiences in being excluded from various groups, would interpret it differently.

Moreover, as consumers we are all free to interpret all works of art in any way we want.
And as an artwork becomes less specific and more abstract, the interpretation of it becomes more and more up to the viewer, and
less and less up to the artist.

## [So What?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqNTltOGh5c)

Ok so abstractions are important in music, painting, and other art forms.  [So what?!?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqNTltOGh5c)

### Hello, My Name Is...

Hello, my name is [Tom Hartung](http://www.tomhartung.com) and I am the creator of [seeourminds.com](http://seeourminds.com)
and [groja.com](http://groja.com).

Like most people, I've been a music fan all my life!
After learning about painters like Wassily Kandisky, Francisco Goya, Pablo Picasso,
[Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian)  - who is my personal favorite - and many others in
graduate school at [VCU](http://vcu.edu), I wrote a program that draws images of personalities.

Actually, over the years I have written [four versions of the program](https://www.groja.com/about),
and all too frequently I get strange looks when I tell people about it.
Knowing that most people love music - which by its nature is very abstract - I wrote these articles to clear away
some of the mystery behind [Abstract Art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Art).

I feel the time has finally come to start actively sharing my idea of visualizing personalities - which are also by their
nature very abstract - with the world at large, and am sure
[I will get some pushback](https://medium.com/@seeourminds/and-the-ugly-8921a8e9c721) from people who are not yet ready for the idea.
So I wrote these articles to preemptively address the criticism I will surely get from people whose backgrounds are different from mine.

The process of writing these articles was a long one - a few decades, in actual fact.
I only hope you have found them entertaining and enlightening!

### Thanks!

Thank you for reading this article!
