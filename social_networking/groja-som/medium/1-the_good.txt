---------------------------------
For important background information, see 0-the_good-the_bad-and_the_ugly-overview.txt in this directory.

Essential Content:
I want to help people see past the surface.
I love to draw personalities, and have written a program to help me do this.
I love to learn and in addition to learning numerous computer languages I have studied music, drawing,
painting, photography, film, and dance.  I took my first ballet class when I was in my 40s.
[Mention of Kandinsky's triangle here.  I am thinking that should be a whole separate article....]
If anyone is qualified to say what art is and is not, it is me.
And I call this "Art."  It expresses how I look at people; it's an expression of how I view our world.
In this respect, I feel it's similar to what modern painters such as Picasso have done.
Down-to-earth, pragmatic, closed-minded people may find this arrogant.
Down-to-earth, pragmatic, closed-minded people thought the Beatles were arrogant, and burned their albums in the mid-1960s.

Some will pick up on the patterns more quickly than others.  Some will close themselves off to it completely right from the start.
Such is the movement of The Triangle.
Publishing more examples will help more people get it, but that takes time, a lot of time.
I believe having enough examples will enable Artificially Intelligent programs to get it.
If you want to stay ahead of the machines, I recommend you invest some time understanding the idea behind these images.
It has taken me decades to create this site.
If you don't appreciate this, please continue on to Part 2: The Bad.
