With that teenage feeling of immortality combined with the impending doom of the Cold War hanging over our heads, it was a good time to smoke cigarettes.  In Richmond in those days, they were 25 cents a pack.  There were friends, beer and The Grateful Dead, and work and school.

<h3>Lesson Learned From Quitting the Ciggies</h3>

Tobacco is a great drug!
When you're down it can make you feel better.
When you're tense it can calm you down.
Too bad it is deadly!

When I quit smoking in 2002 I learned that I'd been self-medicating with tobacco &mdash; using it to repress my anger when people'd insult me.
People would say something rude, I'd go smoke, and feel better.  Free speech, <q>sticks and stones,</q> and all that, right?

When I no longer had that crutch, that place to go to, I had to face this anger.
And I decided I am not going to kill myself just to be nice to assholes.

Unfortunately, some of my <q>friends</q> from those days don't get that, and have insisted on being condescending, manipulative, rude, and flat out insulting.
I've found that ....
More than one of these old <q>friends</q> can no longer lay claim to that title.

If people aren't going to respect you, sometimes <q>better relationships</q> means <q>no relationship.</q>
