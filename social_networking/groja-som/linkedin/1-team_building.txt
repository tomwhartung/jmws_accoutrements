Team Building
-------------

My theory
Diversity that is based on demographics is superficial at best.
It seems to me that even the smallest team needs to have members that can cover all four functions (i.e., all four colors) to some extent

Techie Startups in Particular
Everyone uses a computer.  Hence, the market for technical products is diverse.
Having a well-rounded, diverse team is essential to developing a product that appeals to a diverse set of customers.

Looking for two things:
1. Sales person
2. Small teams to test my theory

My team: Currently 1 member
As evidence of this I offer my sites, seeourminds.com and groja.com .
I am aware that, on the surface, the idea that forms the basis of these sites is not very pragmatic, not very down-to-earth.
And I have extensive experience in facing the difficulties inherent in attempting to monetizing any sort of product based on abstractions.
(I am totally fine with this, and know where I can find more pragmatic people to help me with this, if this is something I decide to do.)
Feel confident that I have the Red and Green covered ok.  It's my idea and I want to make my own decisions.
Also feel confident that I have the Blue covered.
Looking for an Extravert with Yellow (Sensing).  Someone pragmatic who can help me sell this idea.

Small teams
Naturally it would be easiest to test out my theory on small teams, four people max.
These people would have to embrace their own preference and respect the other team members' preferences.
I would like to test this idea of building a psychologically diverse team on a few small teams other than my own.
This would be for a very low price, perhaps even for free (e.g., if you're already a friend of mine irl).
If you would be interested in participating in this pilot program, please contact me!
