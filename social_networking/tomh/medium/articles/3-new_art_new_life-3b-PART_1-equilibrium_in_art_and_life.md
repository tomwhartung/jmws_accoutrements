After giving it some thought, I have decided to write a series of articles, focusing the first of them on Mondrian's notion of equilibrium.

# Ultimate Goal of This Article

To be able to reference this article in a subsequent article about my vision.

### Sub-title: "Part 1: Equilibrium in Art and Life"

This is Part 1 in an series of occasional articles about why Piet Mondrian went from painting
[representational images]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(arts) ) to painting
[abstract images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art).
His writings reveal his reasons for this progression.  These writings are profound and enlightening, but can be difficult to understand.

This article focuses on the parallels he saw between the evolution of his art and the progress of culture and life itself.
Subsequent articles will be about other ideas — such as liberation and high universal morality — that he describes in his writings.

### Introducing Piet Mondrian

[Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) was born in 1872, in the town of
[Amersfoort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amersfoort) in the
[Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands).  He started painting at an early age and in 1892 entered the
[Academy for Fine Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksakademie_van_beeldende_kunsten) in
[Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam).

His early works were representational - landscapes containing fields, rivers, windmills, and the like.
His 1909 painting View from the Dunes with Beach and Piers, Domburg is an example of his work at this time.

In 1909 he also joined the [Theosophical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophical_Society).
[Theosophists](https://www.theosophical.org/) "encourage open-minded inquiry into world religions, philosophy, science, and the
arts in order to understand the wisdom of the ages, respect the unity of all life, and help people explore spiritual self-transformation."

Understanding this, in turn, requires understanding the difference between equality, harmony, and what he called equilibrium.

### The New Art, The New Life

Piet completed his final book, *The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships,*
in 1931, but by then had been working on it since at least 1921.
It is short but profound and abstract - so much so that
[The Collected Works of Piet Mondrian,](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Art-Life-Collected-Twentieth-Century/dp/0306805081)
published in 1987, bears the same title.

Mondrian believed that art and life follow similar paths:
> In life every sincere effort leads to human evolution, and it is the same in art.  Rightly seen, there remains *a single path of evolution* that, regardless of time, *is identical for life and for art.*

He also believed the path that art and life follow is one of purification and equilibrium of opposites:
> If art is an expression of life and anticipates it, we can state that the new life is *the culture of equivalent relationships.*  Just as with the plastic means in art, it is evident that for this life our mentality must become more or less purified, not in an old-fashioned puritanical way, but so as to rise above the oppression of limiting, particular forms.  Thus in the same way as art, life reaches a state of real equilibrium *through pure and equivalent relationships of increasingly free individuals.*

How and why did Mondrian develop his distinctive style, and what are the implications of it for us today and in the future?
This article seeks to answer those questions!

### [(Possible) Conclusion]

This short book was not published during his lifetime.
I believe this is because he was so far ahead of his time.
It is also so abstract that it is difficult to understand - even for me, and I love abstract stuff!
