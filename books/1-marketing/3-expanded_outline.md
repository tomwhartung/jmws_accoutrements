# Outline - Including Images

## Preface: It's Really Quite Simple

The thought of visualizing a personality sounds strange at first, but it's really quite simple.

### Observations and Choices

Every living thing is constantly:

- Observing: perceiving, gathering and assimilating information, and
- Doing things: making decisions based on our observations - and observing the results

Even when we are going through the motions on a typical day, even when dreaming,
we are either observing or doing something.

Sometimes - such as when we are using muscle memory and on automatic pilot - we
can even be doing both at the same time!

#### Preferences Happen

Every living thing - animals and more recently even some machines - has
a preference for either observing or doing something.

This preference may be subconscious, and it **may be great or slight.**

To create a Spiritual Portrait I combine a person's
preference for observing or choosing with a few more similar
preferences into what I call a "Groja[footnote]".

#### These Preferences Are Abstract

Personalities are abstract, so the images are abstract.

It's really just that simple.


## Introduction

Questions:

- Are you as happy as you could be?
- Would you like to know why some people just rub you the wrong way, right from the start?
- Do you really know yourself?
- Do you ever wonder why other people aren't more like you?
- Could your relationships be better?
- Do you ever wonder where other people are coming from?
- Would you like to know why you relate to some fictional characters better than others?
- Do you go through life without direction, just responding to things, like flotsam?
- Etc., "as many as possible"
- Would you like to know why
- Do you ever wonder why

**Grojas can help with all of these issues**


### Why Would You Want an Image of Your Personality?

[This section should address **all** questions in the previous section.]

- Gain insight into recurring people problems
- Wake up - increase awareness of self and others
  - It's always nice to bring unconscious information to the surface
- All of us are expressing these traits in our daily actions
  - Take control - choose self-knowledge over floating through life like flotsam
  - Many of us are already subconsciously processing this information to varying degrees
  - All I am doing is making the invisible visible
- Good to know what sort of work you are best suited for
  - For example, if you are naturally drawn to work that is easily automated, wouldn't you want to know about it?
- Key Point: the images reflect the strength of the preferences
  - People with mild preferences are very different from those with strong preferences - and the images reflect that
  - Strong preferences in particular are visible immediately
    - Meyers-Briggs warns repeatedly that a strong supporting function is essential for all types
    - For example: stubbornness and haplessness


The fact that we are all going to die is a big reason you might want to get your spiritual portrait!

#### Death - Yours and Mine

If **you** die without getting your spiritual portrait, no one will ever know what it looks like.

You cannot answer the questions when you are dead.
Someone else could answer them for you, but **their answers will never be
as accurate as yours.**

The result will be only an imitation, not the real thing.

Also: if **I** die before you get your spiritual portrait, it will be only
an imitation, not the real thing.

I have been drawing personalities like this for over forty years.
When I am gone, someone **might** take an interest in this project and
they **might** be able to replicate my process, but I am the only
person who can create the real thing.

[**Key point**]
The best way to get the most accurate image of your personality is for me to
make your spiritual portrait while we are both still alive.

#### Insight Into Yourself and others

Having your spiritual portrait allows you to better understand:

- Why you do the things you do
- Where others are coming from
- Why you relate better to some people - both real and fictional - than to others

[**Key point**]
Even if you are conscious of your preferences, being able to visualize your own
preferences is incredibly enlightening.

### Are You Too Busy - or Afraid of the Unknown?

My spiritual portraits are reasonably priced, so what do you have to lose?

For many people, answering a questionnaire may seem like too much work.
It may bring back unpleasant memories of the quizzes, tests, and exams we
suffered through in school.

For others, I have another theory: some people are afraid of their own subconscious.

#### Fear

Are you afraid of your own subconscious?
Regrettably, I feel some people are.

Do you prefer to go through life "naturally?"
Are you afraid that seeing your spiritual portrait might reveal a "dark side?"

There is nothing unnatural about a spiritual portrait.
One of my images will never reveal whether you are good or bad - but it
can reveal your motivations, which may be subconscious - for being the way
you are.

[**Key point**]
But if you think it's best to coast through life, responding instinctively
rather than consciously to whatever it throws at you, you will not
appreciate having your spiritual portrait.

### Mindfulness

Mindfulness is becoming increasingly popular - and for a good reason.
We now have more options than ever before for how to spend our time more,
so it's important to make the best of the limited time we have here.

Some people are more aware than others of the power of their
perceptions and the impacts of their decisions.
This awareness tends to increase as we get older - particularly if we
start being more mindful of our observations and actions - and we
feel good about improving ourselves by learning from our mistakes.

But mindfulness is not for everyone.
Indeed, some people steadfastly refuse to learn from their mistakes,
thinking that somehow shows they are weak.

[**Key point**]
Spiritual portraits can give mindfulness a fresh framework for understanding
who we are and how we might improve.

### What:

[Don't go too deep - for details refer them to the How-to.]
[It's ok to expand on ideas hinted at in the Prologue, because some
people will skip the Prologue entirely.]

#### What do you do?

What do you do in your life?

No matter who you are, you:

Open ourselves to observing things
- See, hear, touch, smell, and taste
  - Even animals and machines can do these things
- After awhile, we begin to see patterns and get ideas
  - In general humans are better at these things than animals and machines

Process our observations to make decisions
- Many decisions are subconscious: reflexive, instinctive, and habitual
- After awhile, we develop a tendency to:
  - Make logical decisions that are consistent and determined by external circumstances
  - Make emotional decisions that can vary and are determined by how we feel at the moment
  - Consciously consider both alternatives and pick the one best suited to the situation

In most people, one of these - observing or deciding - takes precedence.
In a minority of people - I call them "chameleonesque" - these tendencies are balanced.

Finally, people tend to direct their dominant preference either outwardly or inwardly.

#### What do the images represent?

- Introduce what Grojas are:
  - The images must be abstract because personalities are abstract
  - They are based on Jungian Achetypes
    - Myers Briggs codified and commercialized Jung's typology, and adapted his methodology into the popular four-letter type shorthand
- What each of the colors represent
  - Refer to About page on Groja.com, **do not duplicate it**
    - Possibly refer to Appendix, where there might be more information
  - Sensing-Yellow versus iNtuition-Blue
    - Three or more adjectives for each, at least one each positive, neutral, and negative
    - N vs. S - Perceptions
      - As different as night and day
      - The biggest differences between people
  - Thinking-Green versus Feeling-Red
    - Three or more adjectives for each, at least one each positive, neutral, and negative
    - F vs. T - Motivations
      - Warm vs. Cool
      - The source of most difficulties between people
- What the horizontal and vertical lines represent
  - These images use:
    - Vertical lines to represent the preference the person directs outwardly
    - Horizontal lines to represent the preference the person directs inwardly
  - When the dominant function is directed outwardly, the image contains a long vertical line to the left of the image's center
    - These are extraverts and it is usually quickly obvious who they are
  - When the dominant function is directed inwardly, the image contains a long vertical line underneath the image's center
    - These are introverts and it often takes some time to learn who they are
  - When a person's preferences are very strong, these lines may get lost, but they are there


### Who:

How to determine whether you would like to see your Spiritual Portrait.

- World's Shortest Personality Quiz - or Something
  - Instant Personality Quiz?
  - Two questions, pick where you are on the continuum
    - Use at least positive, neutral, and negative synonym on each side
    - Use the colors subtlely in the continuum - a gradient with white in the middle might be nice
    - S ------- N - where are you, on a scale of 1-10?
    - T ------- F - where are you, on a scale of 1-10?
  - What your score means:
    - If your score is 10 or more, you will like your spiritual portrait
      - The higher your score, the better chance you will like it
    - If your score is less than 10, a spiritual portrait is not for you
      - The lower your score, the less probability you will like it

- How it works
  - Personality traits and images of personalities are abstract
    - If you are more N than S,
    - If you are more Blue than Yellow,
    - If you prefer ideas to facts,
    - If you are more comfortable with abstractions than most,
    - Then you will understand the images more easily
  - Personality traits and images of personalities are all about people
    - If you are more F than T,
    - If you are more Red than Green,
    - If you prefer emotions to logic,
    - If you'd rather work with people than things,
    - Then you will understand the images more easily


### Conclusion - The Pitch

**Review Daniel Pink's book before completing this section.**

#### Benefits

Grojas can help with:

- Self-awareness
- Relationships - personal & professional teams - explain how briefly
- Etc. - review salient points from the Selling Points section.

#### Pricing

Pricing is variable.
If you see us running a special offer, you would be wise to take advantage of it.

- Increased demand:
  - May well drive up the price of hand-crafted images
  - May push me to better automate production, so the price will always be reasonable
- Images of similar personalities will look similar, but no two images will never be identical

#### FAQ

[Idea: resist the temptation to add a FAQ until we actually have real live questions that are getting asked frequently.]

### Appendix: How to Draw a Personality

This will be **the definitive, detailed How-to,** to be excerpted from and adapted into articles for posting on social networking sites.

So it's ok to delve into details.  Dive away!

Consider doing all or portions of this as an infographic - see TODOs below.

- Choose what qualities you want to portray
  - For example, Jungian, Big 5, something from the DSM, etc.
- Find a questionnaire
  - Find an existing questionnaire that is OK to use, or write your own, or both
- Decide how to represent the qualities
  - For example, what shapes and colors to use for these traits, what types vectors for those traits, etc.
- Consider writing a program to do the work
  - Writing a program to convert the results to an image is **not** necessary, but it makes it easy to create consistent images
- Obtain personality profiles and draw them!
  - Get people to answer the questionnaire

- TODOs:
  1. Adapt this into an infographic and post to pinterst
  2. Adapt this How-to into an article and post to medium
