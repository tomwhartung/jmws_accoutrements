Putting off upgrading jane, barbara, and ava for now.

- Table of Ubuntu Versions:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#Table_of_versions
- Important Points:
  - 16.04 LTS is supported until 2021-04-01 - so upgrading these is not urgent
  - 18.04 LTS is supported until 2028-04-01 - so we will need to upgrade eventually
