 Getting Comfortable
=====================
Install the basic stuff we need to get around and do the other stuff.

This is the process we are running to set up ava.
-------------------------------------------------
Parts of it should be perfectly usable on other servers.

Server Necessities for Comfortableness
--------------------------------------
[ ] Home Directory - should be minimal for servers
    Copy selected files and directories from home directory on another host
      .bashrc, .bash_aliases*, .gitconfig, .vimrc, backup, bin, r*
[ ] Install any new updates
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
[ ] Install rcs, vim, subversion, openssh-server, git, git-svn, (??git-stuff, git-magic??)
    -> Note: many packages already installed
       See ./0-windows_install.txt, under Questions and Answers -> Packages to install
    sudo apt-get install rcs vim subversion
    sudo apt-get install openssh-server
    sudo apt-get install git git-svn
[ ] Set up root account: .bashrc, links to .bash_aliases*
    As root:
      cd /mnt
      mkdir usb
      mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
    Copy files to ~tomh and ~root as appropriate
      ln -s ~tomh/.bash_aliases .
      ln -s ~tomh/.bash_aliases-ava  .
      ln -s ~tomh/bin  .
      ln -s ~tomh/.vimrc   .
      vi .bashrc    ## Add cusTOMizations
      which ci
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l .bashrc
[ ] Setup static IP

      https://michael.mckinnon.id.au/2016/05/05/configuring-ubuntu-16-04-static-ip-address/
    As root:
      cd /etc/network
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l interfaces
      vi interfaces
      -> Update as indicated in References above
[ ] Update /etc/hosts and verify ssh is working
    Installing openssh-server seems to be enough to get it going
    Combine public keys from other hosts into authorized_keys
    As tomh:
      ssh-keygen
      cd ~/.ssh
      cat pubs/* >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
      Push over a copy of /etc/hosts
    As root:
      cd /etc
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l hosts fstab
      cat hosts
      more ~tomh/tmp/hosts
      mv ~tomh/tmp/hosts .
      vi hosts
      ci -l hosts
    Test using ssh to get from host to host.
