Having given it some thought, I have decided to abandon this line of thought as well for a new one.

It seems prudent though to also save this "version," minimal as it is, for possible future reference.

# Goal - The Big Picture

To be able to reference this article in a subsequent article about my vision, and then
able to reference *that* article (about my vision) in a *subsequent* article about the
goals and reasons for creating seeourminds.com .

# The Article - such as it is

## Title

It is now obvious this title is too broad:

- The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian

Titles of articles to be actually published must be much more specific.

## Body - New, and Unused

This is not a bad start, overall!

We just need to narrow the focus of subsequent articles, so as to not be overwhelmed and made unproductive as a result.

### ("Cold" Introduction)

Piet Mondrian completed his final book, *The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships,*
in 1931, but by then had been working on it since at least 1921.
It is short but profound and abstract - so much so that
[The Collected Works of Piet Mondrian,](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Art-Life-Collected-Twentieth-Century/dp/0306805081)
published in 1987, bears the same title.

Mondrian believed that art and life follow similar paths:
> In life every sincere effort leads to human evolution, and it is the same in art.  Rightly seen, there remains *a single path of evolution* that, regardless of time, *is identical for life and for art.*

He also believed the path that art and life follow is one of purification and equilibrium of opposites:
> If art is an expression of life and anticipates it, we can state that the new life is *the culture of equivalent relationships.*  Just as with the plastic means in art, it is evident that for this life our mentality must become more or less purified, not in an old-fashioned puritanical way, but so as to rise above the oppression of limiting, particular forms.  Thus in the same way as art, life reaches a state of real equilibrium *through pure and equivalent relationships of increasingly free individuals.*

How and why did Mondrian develop his distinctive style, and what are the implications of it for us today and in the future?
This article seeks to answer those questions!

### Introducing Piet Mondrian

### The Power of Abstractions

This is where the original idea becomes intractable.

#### Abstractions in Religion

One might say that gods are the ultimate abstractions.

This could make a nice **short** article with a broad appeal!  **Keep it short though!**

It sucks that differences of specifics - "particular forms" - are the source of so much violence!
