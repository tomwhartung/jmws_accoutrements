# First Contract

Hint: keep it simple!

## References

These are the URLs from whence I am getting the content of my first contract.

## Notes

1. I don't really feel a contract is necessary at this time, I just want to start off on the right foot.
2. Priority is given to any items that appear in two or more of the above references.

## Process

Here is the process I am using:

1. Start with text file
2. Copy-and-paste desired bits from the references
3. Import into word doc
4. Refine and send

Note that this means the word doc might be a bit more up-to-date than the text file!

## Results

Results are in this repo with the customer's other files:
