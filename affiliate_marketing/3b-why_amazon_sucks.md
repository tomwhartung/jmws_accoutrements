It did not suprise me, but I find myself rather hurt by amazon's rejection nonetheless,
no doubt because I busted ass trying to get accepted and was blind-sided by
complete BS.
I mean seriously, two dead links in the response?  What a bunch of losers.

My takeaway is, they feel I do not have enough traffic.
I read on one site or other that they just want to see traffic.
My response is, I'm not ready to have a great deal of traffic right now.
Fucking asshoes.

So welcome to my polemic, **Why Amazon Sucks.**

> The Amazon - Facebook - Google future is a weird, gruesome, outlandish,
> freakish dystopia. People work in warehouses where their bosses are
> algorithms - but don’t have decent healthcare, incomes, savings - all
> so that other people can have stuff delivered in two hours, versus two
> days. Then they come home, where their "communities" are also algorithms -
> algorithms tell them what to think, who to befriend, whom to date, what to
> read, what to buy, and so on. In this future, people aren’t really human
> beings anymore - they are just interchangeable commodities, just
> "information," whose digital representations are endlessly "arbitraged,"
> bought low and sold high - who are exploited at every turn. First for
> their physical labour, then for their intellects and creativity, then
> for their emotions, relationships, sexuality, curiousity, empapthy, and
> sociality. All these are strip-mined, and what’s left is a smoking,
> carved out wreck - of a society, democracy, planet, person, future.
> In this future, people are a little deader, crazier, angrier, dumber,
> meaner - doesn’t it feel that way a little bit already?

> Amazon, on the other hand, is testing the hypothesis that none of the
> above matters. Nothing does, really. Not just to it - but also to you.
> That the only thing that matters is the lowest price, in the fastest way.
> That’s it, period, full stop. How many times have I ordered something
> from Amazon in the last year just because it was dirt cheap, and it was
> delivered lightning-fast? I can’t even remember. It’s terrible - but it’s
> also a little stupid, because I’d say about 99% of that stuff has ended
> up being junk, either defective, unusable, or shoddy, often all three.
> But Amazon doesn’t care. Why should it? It’s like the world’s biggest,
> worst, sleaziest mall.

> Earlier this year, the writer and artist Jenny Odell began to look into
> an Amazon reseller that had bought goods from other Amazon resellers and
> resold them, again on Amazon, at higher prices. Odell discovered an
> elaborate network of fake price-gouging and copyright-stealing businesses
> connected to the cultlike Evangelical church whose followers resurrected
> Newsweek in 2013 as a zombie search-engine-optimized spam farm. She
> visited a strange bookstore operated by the resellers in San Francisco
> and found a stunted concrete reproduction of the dazzlingly phony
> storefronts she’d encountered on Amazon, arranged haphazardly with
> best-selling books, plastic tchotchkes, and beauty products apparently
> bought from wholesalers.
