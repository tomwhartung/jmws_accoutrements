Included with the release is a single sheet folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure.  The front duplicates the cover of the CD and the back contains an oval-shaped photograph, tinted in purple and green, of the sound system.  Credited to Mary Ann Mayer, surrounding the photo is a background of clouds that flows seamlessly into the clouds on the cover.

The two pages inside contain a series of black-and-white photographs of the band members on stage.  Above this series of photos are lists of the contents of and credits for the release.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 12, &copy; 1974, 1998.</ref>
