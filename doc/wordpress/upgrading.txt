Introduction
------------
The process seems to change about the time I get used to it and acheive a comfortable level of automation and documentation.
Plus we don't run it often enough to be really confident about it or good at it etc.

TomWHartung.com - WP Upgrading Notes for 2015
---------------------------------------------
Trying to update using the back end administrator's panel...
bette - FTP settings (undoubtedly firewall issues - I don't see how it could work with my setup)
lauren - took a few tries, finally got it to work!  (I hope!)

Getting core update to work from back end on lauren (4.2.3 to 4.3.1):
---------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Backup db on all hosts:
   bu tw 01-before_upgrade_4.2.3_to_4.3.1
1. Changed the following:
o  Changed ownership of all files to www-data
o  Created directory wp-content/upgrade
o  Changed perms of wp-content to 775
   -> Changed back to 755 (see Updating Plugins below)
o  Changed perms of all subdirectories of wp-content to 775
   -> Changed back to 755 (see Updating Plugins below)
2. What finally worked (apparently)
o  Added the following line to wp-config.php :
   define('FS_METHOD','direct');
o  References:
   https://wordpress.org/support/topic/core-or-plugin-update-could-not-create-directory-httpdocs?replies=27
   http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/141063/when-fs-method-direct-is-chosen
o  Based on the second reference it appears the chmoding and chowning were necessary so leaving all that as-is
3. Quick check in browser: Looks OK

Updating wp core on development and backup hosts
------------------------------------------------
1. Checkin to git on lauren and push:
   gotwt
   gs
   ga --all .
   gc 'Updating to 4.3.1' ; gpom
2. Extract (git pull) on dev and bu hosts
   gotwt
   gp
3. Test in browser
   Load admin panel: "Database update required."
   Click "Update Wordpress Database " button: "Your WordPress database has been successfully updated."
   Click "Continue" button: looks like we are good to go!
   Noting that permission changes made above are not reflected on dev and bu hosts
4. Backup new copy of db on all
   bu tw 02-after_upgrade_to_4.3.1

Updating plugins
----------------
Learned that to enable updates via the admin panel (at least for plugins) we just need to:
1. Add the following line to wp-config.php :
   define('FS_METHOD','direct');
2. Run following commands:
   cd /var/www/tomwhartung.com/htdocs/tomwhartung.com
   chown -R www-data *
However, to get git to work again, we need to chown the files back to tomh.

Updating themes
---------------
Need to update three themes.
Let's see if I can get this process down "to a science," based on what we learned above.

Upgrade template on bette:
   bu tw 04-before_upgrade_twentyfifteen
   chown -R www-data
   upgrade in admin panel
   chown -R tomh
   test
   git commit and push
   bu tw 05-after_upgrade_twentyfifteen
   copy db to jane
Upgrade code and db on jane using results from upgrade on bette
   bu tw 04-before_upgrade_twentyfifteen
   git pull
   rs -h bette tw 05-after_upgrade_twentyfifteen
   test
   bu tw 05-after_upgrade_twentyfifteen
Repeat processes for bette and jane for:
   twentyfourteen
   twentythirteen
Upgrade code and db on lauren using final results from upgrade on bette
   bu tw 04-before_upgrade_twentyfifteen
   git pull
   rs -h bette tw 05-after_upgrade_twentyfifteen
   test
   bu tw 05-after_upgrade_twentyfifteen
