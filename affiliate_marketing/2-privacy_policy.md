Ok, it's becoming obvious that, if I want to set up some affiliate marketing, I need a Privacy Policy.

Yikes (I could get sued) and hmm (more stuff to learn about) and ugh (legalese, ugh).

## Requirements

- Privacy Policy (PP) must be general yet specific enough to use on any of my sites
- The PP should allow for:
  - Displaying AdSense ads
  - Selling (or giving away) images
  - Affiliate marketing
  - Building a list of fans' email addresses
  - Ask for donations

Importantly: "Unless you can absolutely guarantee that no users from the EU will ever find their way to your website,
youâ€™ll need a GDPR notice and compliant consent measures."  (From the last link in the above list.)
