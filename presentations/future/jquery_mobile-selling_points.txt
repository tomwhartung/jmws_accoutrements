jQuery Mobile is huge and offers a lot of functionality, including:

Content-related features:

o  Various transitions between pages

o  Dialog boxes

o  Expandable/Collapsible content (accordion, etc.)

Integrating with phone

o  Ability to make a call using POAT <a href="tel:+18005555555">Call Us Now!</a>
   (POAT = Plain Old Anchor Tags)

o  Ability to use facetime on iPhone and iPod to create a video call link

o  Ability to react to the mailto: protocol

o  Ability to invoke SMS from a link with sms:// and smsto://


Toolbars: not just for navigation

I am using the toolbars for menus, but with jQuery Mobile you can use icons with them and do all sorts of things
