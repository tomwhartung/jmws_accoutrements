 Goals
=======
It really helps to be clear about these, especially if I am going to be seeking advice from others.

Top Goals in Order of Importance
--------------------------------
1. Resilience
Long life, willing to do the work I love for most of it, even to the very end.

2. Money
We all need it, the more the better, at least up to a point.

3. Long-term Engagement
Want to keep up-to-date with changes and trends, and continue working in some capacity.
I enjoy my work and always learning, and want to do both as long as I can.

4. Work-Life balance
It's either free-lancing or full-time, except for maybe a short while
o Doing both in the long run is not desireable
o Hence preference for short-term projects
o Updating online presence for freelancing seems to me to preclude full-time work
  *** Belongs in 2-perceptions ?? ***

5. Self-actualization
For details, see 1-self-assessment .

An Obvious Concern (and Solution)
---------------------------------
o Balancing 2 & 3 can be tricky.
o Freelancing/self-employment can make that easier
  Part-time: exercise established skills for the money
  Part-time: keep up to date with changes and trends
