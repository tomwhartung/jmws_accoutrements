Agreement

This agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into by Tom W. Hartung of JooMoo WebSites ("Writer"), and Tonya Lou Haley of Avid Digital Works ("Client").

Relationship

The parties expressly agree and acknowledge that the relationship created by this Agreement is one of Independent Contractor.

The Client is not the employer of The Writer, and The Writer is not, and will not be treated as, an employee of The Client for federal tax purposes, or any other purposes.

Deliverable to Be Provided

The Writer will deliver an article of approximately 600 words about "Commercial Security & Fire Alarm Systems."

Description of the Deliverable

The article will be a single text (.txt) file only, with no formatting or images.

To help organize the article’s content, it may include one or more suggested headings, to be recognized as such by being incomplete sentences appearing on a single line.

The article may include a few links to references, that may or may not appear in the final version of the posted article, to ease in possibly making revisions.

Purpose:
The primary purpose of the article is to describe what types of security cameras (and alarms, if space allows) are available.

The secondary purpose is to ensure the reader that 2D Electronics is willing and able to take care of all aspects involved in installing the security cameras (and alarms, if space allows).

Content:
The article will focus primarily on Commercial Security Cameras.
If space permits, it will provide information about Commercial Alarm Systems.

Revisions

In light of the fact that this the first article that The Writer is delivering for The Client, The Writer agrees to make up to two revisions to the article, in the hopes that we may learn how best to work together and The Writer may subsequently create and deliver additional articles.

Request for Keywords:
If The Client could supply a list of keywords to be used in the article, this could help The Writer supply an acceptable article that is less likely to require one or more revisions.

Representations and Warranties of Writer

By submitting an article to The Client, The Writer represents and warrants that the Article is The Writer's original work, that the Article is not owned by any third party, that the Article is accurate, that the Article has not been obtained by unlawful means, and that the Article has not been previously published in any manner or medium.

Cost of the Deliverable

In light of the fact that this the first and most basic of what could be several articles (that may turn out to be of increasing complexity) The Writer is offering this article for $0.10 per word.

Preferred Payment Method

Upon final acceptance of the deliverable, The Client may request an invoice by sending an email to payments@joomoowebsites.com , or may simply remit the agreed-upon fee to The Writer via the payments@joomoowebsites.com account at www.paypal.com .

Taxes

As an Independent Contractor, Writer shall be responsible for the reporting, deposit, and payment of any and all federal, state, and local taxes, including but not limited to income taxes, FICA taxes, and unemployment taxes incidental to the performance of, or payment under this Agreement.

Assignment and Ownership of Intellectual Property

Writer hereby understands and agrees that all Articles submitted to, and published by, The Client under this Agreement shall be considered works for hire, and further, to the extend any intellectual property right does not pass pursuant to a work for hire, Writer hereby assigns to Newspaper all rights to publish the Article, and all previously submitted articles of Writer, in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which it can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device, including without limitation the rights to archive, republish, edit, repackage or revise any Article in any manner as The Client sees fit.

The rights conferred upon The Client by this agreement shall be exclusive to The Client for a period of three years after the first date The Client initially publishes the Article.

This Agreement is entered into on this 30th day of August, 2017.
