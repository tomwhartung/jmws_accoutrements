Introduction
------------
The process seems to change about the time I get used to it and acheive a comfortable level of automation and documentation.
Plus we don't run it often enough to be really confident about it or good at it etc.
If the download button doesn't work it is probably because of my firewall or there is something missing in my configuration, or both.
Moreover, I feel it's best to fall back on the tried and true command line methods, so I know what's going on in the event of a problem.
This could back fire though, I suppose, in the event of changes to the structure of the db.  Hmmm.
So we save the old code and db, just in case we need to back up and problem solve....
