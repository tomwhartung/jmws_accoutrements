 Installing Groja VM on Jane
=============================
Prerequisite: Thumb drive with copy of VM built on bette.

References:
-----------
See ../2017-groja1-bette/0-vm_install.txt
Because we have already created the VM, this process is considerably easier.

On Linux System, Before Installing a New VM:
--------------------------------------------
[ ] Set up bridged networking
[ ] Install KVM and dependencies
    See doc/ubuntu/specific_hosts/2016-bette/3-experimenting_with_extras.txt

Unpack tar file and use it to create a new VM
---------------------------------------------
[ ] Find a file system with at least 22G of disk, needed to unpack the tar file (!!!)
    As root:
      mkdir /usr/local/tar/zzz-unpack_vm
      cd /usr/local/tar/zzz-unpack_vm
      cp /media/tomh/FATTHUMB4-1/var_lib_libvirt-groja1.tgz .
      tar -xvzf var_lib_libvirt-groja1.tgz
      chown -R tomh libvirt
    Must run chown to avoid permissions issues later
    Warning: this takes up a lot (22G) of disk!
[ ] Run KVM Virtual Machine Manager and create a new VM
    Use icon locked to launcher or use Search your computer icon to start the
      KVM Virtual Machine Manager
    File -> New VM: New VM dialog
      Import existing disk image -> Forward
      Provide the existing storage path:
        Browse (local) to: /usr/local/tar/zzz-unpack_vm/images
        Select file: groja1.qcow2 -> Forward
      Choose Memory and CPU settings (accept defaults)
        Memory (RAM): 1024 MiB
        CPUs: 1 (Up to 2 available) -> Forward
      Create a new virtual machine
        Name: groja1 -> Finish

[ ] Cleanup
    As root:
      cd /usr/local/tar/zzz-unpack_vm
      rm -fr *
      cd ..
      rmdir zzz-unpack_vm
