===''Europe '72, Vol. 1: Wembley Empire Pool, London, England (4/7/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/7/1972 Gary Lambert sets the scene by writing that "the Dead were overshandowed by ''the'' pop culture story in the U.K. at the time, a fleeing craze known as '[Bolan Mania|https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bolanmania&redirect=no]'".  The author goes on to discuss the "[symbiosis|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis] between the U.S. and U.K rock scenes", and quotes "the great British playwright [Tom Stoppard|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Stoppard]" as saying "Everybody had a sense of that".  Lambert then details how "The first shows were scheduled for April 5-8 at the 3,000-seat [Rainbow Theatre|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Theatre]," then moved to "the Commodore in King Street, Hammersmith, instead of the now closed Rainbow Theatre" and then ultimately "turned into two at the building today known as the [12,000-plus-capacity] [Wembley Arena|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Arena], then called Empire Pool", before closing this contribution with "To be continued on 4/8/72. . ." [elipsis in original].

===''Europe '72, Vol. 2: Wembley Empire Pool, London, England (4/8/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/8/1972 Gary Lambert starts off by quoting [Sam Cutler|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cutler]'s introduction of the band on 4/7/72 and continues building on his notes for the previous show by stating "Sam's instincts proved correct: while no one expected the Dead to fill the Empire Pool, they drew more than respectably&mdash;somwhere in the neighborhood of 8,000 paying customers each night".  Lambert then describes the two nights at the venue as if they were one long show, writing that "By midway through the second set on opening night ... all notions of 'British reserve' were clearly out the window" and "on Night Two in London" the Dead took "an even more fearless dive into the deep unreal".  In the closing paragraph, the author revisits the topic he opened with in his previous piece, writing that "In the edition of [Melody Maker|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody_Maker] immediately following the Empire Pool shows, even 'Bolan Mania' had taken a backseat: most of the front page was devoted to a huge picture of Garcia and his new customized Stratocaster, accompanied by a headline reading [in all caps] 'Dead storm Britain'."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 3: City Hall, Newcastle, England (4/11/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/11/1972 Sam Cutler opens by describing the venue as "a dour concrete building in the midst of a grim industrial town" and stating that "the Grateful Dead were initially dismayed&mdash;it had all the warmth of a witch's teat."  He goes on to say that "the band transcended the limitations of the space" and ultimately the "stunned and bemused" audience "began to relax and get into the music" which "produced many a manic grin".  Rosie McGee adds to Sam's short contribution with her tale of meeting and sitting for a while with "a very nice lady", the mother of [Eric Burdon|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Burdon] of [The Animals|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals], who "reached over and took my hand" at one point and, "Knowing she couldn't be heard over the music, she mouthed the words 'They're very good, you know!' and then smiled and patted my hand."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 4: Tivoli Concert Hall, Copenhagen, Denmark (4/14/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/14/72 Larry Rogers opens by describing "the incredibly intimate Tivoli theater" which "is on the grounds of an amusement park, which seemed about as appropriate as could be" and writes of having "seen the Dead from their earliest days, when they were only Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Stompers" in Palo Alto.  He the writes the show was "1,600 crazed Danes and two folks from La Honda up and shaking our butts" and adds that "The folks at Tivoli that night were in awe of what they were seeing and hearing.  San Francisco, long past its [Summer of Love|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Love], was there before them".  Rogers closes his notes with the same [Danish|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark] quote he opened it with: " 'Sikke en lang underligt tur det har vaeret.'  What a long, strange trip it's been."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 5: Stakladen, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark (4/16/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/16/72 Aarhus University historian Palle Lykke opens by asking "Can you imagine sitting on a cafeteria tray slide for almost four hours" and then reveals that the "relatively small club-like venue" served as "the campus cafeteria" in which "the maximum audience can be no more than 700."  He spends much of his piece describing the logistics of playing in the space, stating "that there was simply nowhere to put" the "45 cafeteria tables and 400 chairs in the room" and "There was no security at all" because "it was not necessary at that time."  Lykke closes his notes by tracing the venue's name to "the Danish noun 'staklade', which means "barn (Danish: 'lade'), a place to store (Danish: 'stakke') loads of straw and grain, a nickname inspired by "the open and visible beams under the roof" which people would "decide to crawl up onto" for a [birds-eye view|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird%27s-eye_view] of the show.

===''Europe '72, Vol. 6: Tivoli Concert Hall, Copenhagen, Denmark (4/17/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/17/72 Blair Jackson writes that "Video and film representations of the Dead in the early '70s are few and far between" making "The 13 songs shot in Denmark that night, using multiple cameras, give us perhaps the best unfiltered look of the Dead in that era" despite the fact that "the cameras weren't on for the third set".  After describing the visual scene and a few of the songs, she claims "it's the version of 'Big Railroad Blues' that ''makes'' this telecast" because one by one the band members put on masks and "wigs with baldpates and bright, crazy Bozo hair" which Bob tells "the, no doubt, confused audience" are "for the TV cameras, you must understand".  Blair closes her piece by declaring "It's the Bozo and Bolo Bus Revue in all their glory" who have, "for this tour", actually somehow "passed for 'normal'."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 7: Beat Club, Bremen, West Germany (4/21/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/21/72 Blair Jackson introduces ''Beat-Club'' as "Germany's first major rock 'n' roll TV show, on the air monthly (or so) since September 1965" and claims that "everyone who was anyone in rock music in the late '60s and early '70s showed up on ''Beat-Club'' at one time or another".  She goes on to write that while most "acts probably came to the studio with a good idea of what [one or two] song(s) they wanted to highlight and knocked it out quickly", the Dead "played a remarkable 80-minute set that mixed short songs with big jamming tunes".  After describing most of the songs in the single set of music they played at this venue, Jackson decides to focus on "the six minutes after the second verse of 'The Other One'," and the idiosyncratic ending to their final song, "which is a mess worthy of the laugh that follows it", closing her piece with a reference to the fairy tale: "And with that the [Town Musicians of Bremen|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_Musicians_of_Bremen] were gone."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 8: Rheinhalle, DÃ¼sseldorf, West Germany (4/24/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/24/72 Blair Jackson begins with "Let us now praise Keith Godchaux", and then proceeds to effusively do just that, following this first single-sentence paragraph with five more much longer ones detailing Keith's contributions to many of the songs the band performed that night.  Using phrases such as "notes dancing on air", "high tinkling that sets the stage for the later jam", and "great bursts of odd chords" she describes his part in the songs "Black-Throated Wind", "Playing in the Band", and "Dark Star".  And after comparing his style to that of [Cecil Taylor|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Taylor], [Floyd Cramer|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Cramer], and [Otis Spann|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Spann], the author ends her notes by saying that "[Jerry Lee|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Lee_Lewis] Godcheaux" may have "never looked flashy, but, man, that guy could really rock it.  And he was never better than he was in 1972."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 9: Jahrhunderthalle, Frankfurt, West Germany (4/26/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/26/72 [David Gans|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gans_(musician)] devotes the first half of his contribution to the Dead's penchant for making a mistake, covering it up, discussing it later, and occasionally sometimes turing it into a "new arrangement".  As an example of this process, he shares a detailed description of the progression from "Lovelight" into "Goin' Down the Road Feeling Bad" from this show as one of the "group-mind moments" that was "just this beautiful, sort of telepathic thing."  Quoting extensively from a radio interview Gans did with Bob Weir and Phil Lesh in 1997, the author writes of how Phil encountered "his doppelganger at the Jahrhundert Halle", identifies the audience as being "mostly servicemen, from the [U.S. Army] Wiesbaden Air Base", and closes his piece by quoting the bassist as saying "I enjoyed every bit of it.  It was great to be in Europe."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 10: Musikhalle, Hamburg, West Germany (4/29/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/29/72 [Steve Silberman|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Silberman] starts by revealing that the "ragtag band of Northern California freaks" felt like Germany was "a country haunted by the past", with "dream-castles shimmering on the Rhine", "ghosts of Nazi ''kommandants''", "and the gods of Phil's musical pantheon calling the fire of the muses down from Heaven or up from hell."  He goes on to assert that this atmosphere "charged some of the most electrifying performances in the Dead's 30-year career", citing "Playing in the Band" which went for "the galactic core just three minutes into the first set" to "Dark Star" which "probe[d] regions of dissonance that would give most latter-day jam bands the vapors" as examples.  After ackowledging that this show had "one of the few double encores of the tour", Silberman closes his piece by quoting lyricist Robert Hunter who, upon realizing that "worlds cannot be saved" declared that "we learned to dance on graves and be glad."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 11: Olympia Theatre, Paris, France (5/3/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 5/3/72 Steve Silberman starts by telling of how "Jerry and Mountain Girl got themselves a room at the [Grand Hotel|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterContinental_Paris_Le_Grand_Hotel] with a balcony" in "the city of Proust and Picasso", and listing some of the many acts&mdash;from [Edith Piaf|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89dith_Piaf] to the [Beatles|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles] to [James Brown|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown]&mdash;who had played at the "storied venue" in the past.  After describing the band's "synergy" as "indistinguishable from telepathy" and the "down-home warmth" brought to the stage by Pigpen, Donna, and Keith, he zeroes in on "the thrilling moment when Bob stepped up to lead a charge from 'China Cat Sunflower' into 'I Know You Rider'."  Claiming "The first set was such a complete experience that many locals assumed the show was over when Bob called for the break", the author mostly glosses over the second set, even though it was "more dynamic than the first", and closes his piece by returning to Jerry and M.G. who "headed back to their angelic aerie" where, "For another night, they were sitting on top of the world."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 12: Olympia Theatre, Paris, France (5/4/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 5/4/72 [Jeff Tamarkin|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Tamarkin] opens his piece by quoting the [Cole Porter|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Porter] song "[I love Paris|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Paris] in the springtime" and paints a romantic scene of "sentimental images of breathtaking days and amorous nights", then asks "Just what the hell did the French make of Pigpen?"  Observing that Ron McKernan "may very well have been the most un-French guy on the planet", the author acknowledges that "Those who knew him tell of his sweetness and romanticism" and to "focus solely on Pigpen's image is to do him an injustice."  Finding it difficult to identify any highlights in the Dead's second show in Paris, Tamarkin declares it was "A little of everything that was the Grateful Dead", and despite the power going out at one point, "the electricity in the Parisian air, channeled by the Grateful Dead, never went away for a second.  ''Splendide!''"

===''Europe '72, Vol. 13: Bickershaw Festival, Wigan, England (5/7/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 5/7/72 Simon Robinson has next to nothing positive to say about the venue, which he claims was "a desolate swamp" that had "a sign by the lake with the terse warning 'crap in water, do not drink'," in weather that "was unseasonably cold, with frequent rain" and "a bitter wind."  Claiming this was made bearable by [Dr. John|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._John]'s performance on Friday and [Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Beefheart], "who played an awesome and astonishing set" on Saturday, the author writes that on Sunday "At last, it was time for the grand finale&mdash;and the Dead did not disappoint."  Happy that "for the first time in three days the sun appeared" and the band "played on and on despite the cold", Robinson ends his piece by writing "Due to the magic of the music and the resilience of the estimated 30,000 attendees, the vast majority appeared to have had a great time despite the conditions, which, by the end, had paled into insignificance."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 14: Concertgebouw, Amsterdam, Holland (5/10/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 5/10/72 Blair Jackson writes that the "sold-out audience of about 2,000" was greeted with "another skull-fuck of an evening on the Dead's Europe tour", which was "about three-and-a half hours" long and thus "one of the longest" of the 22 shows.  Acknowledging that "The first set at Concergebouw doesn't serve up any unusual song choices", she dissects the second set into "three distinct sections", with the "second module" starting "with 'Beat It on Down the Line' " and ending with "another passionate reading of 'Sing Me Back Home' ", and claiming the songs in "the final sprint" make the second set a "super submarine sandwich with all the fixin's."  Jackson then insists on getting "something off my chest" and shifts gears into sharing some details about "how extensively the Dead had overdubbed vocals for the 'Europe '72' album", ultimately revealing that the "vocal coda on 'He's Gone'&mdash;'Oo-oo-oo, nothin's gonna bring him back'&mdash;was ''not'' from" this show, but from a later performance, stating "it was kind of a shock to recall that in the first versions it wasn't there."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 15: Grote Zaal, De Doelen, Rotterdam, Holland (5/11/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 5/11/72 Blair Jackson starts by declaring "All you really need to know about this Rotterdam concert is that it was former Grateful Dead vault-keeper [Dick Latvala|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Latvala]'s favorite show from the Europe '72 tour."  After describing the venue, which is "a beautiful, modern symphony hall (built in 1966) that holds 2,200", she spends most of her contribution describing in painstaking detail why the version of 'Dark Star' the band played that night is "quite unlike the others on the tour (though, of course, they're all different, one to the next)."  Having revealed earlier that Latvala enjoyed "big, fat, juicy jams" more than anything else, she claims that this version of "Dark Star", along with the "first set filled with new and old favorites, and a second-set-opening 'Morning Dew' " explain why he "loved this show so much, and why more than 100,000 people downloaded it from [archive.org|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive]."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 16: Lille Fairgrounds, Lille, France (5/13/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 5/13/72 Nicholas Meriwether, a Grateful Dead archivist at UC Santa Cruz, explains that the show had been "Originally scheduled [for] halfway through the tour, right after the two Paris shows", but had to be postponed due to "an aggrieved young radical" who "After a losing encounter with some ice cream ... decided his revenge would also be served cold."  Thus, when the band showed up in Lille they were unable to play because "much of their equipment remained in Paris in its truck, mired in the politics of adulterated gas", and they had to escape what Bob called a "good and proper" thumping by an irate audience "through the back window."  This show is the result of them coming "back to Lille to make up the show" which, despite being interrupted by a rain storm, turned out to be a "delicate beauty of a day reclaimed and made magic in the way that only the Dead could do."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 17: La Grande Salle Du Grand Theatre, Luxembourg (5/16/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 5/15/72 David Gans reveals the Dead performed this show to "an audience of around 500 people" on "The radio Luxembourg show", which "aired in various formats and frequencies around Europe and globally via shortwave."  In his notes Gans quotes several people, including Tony Middleton who claimed that "Luxembourg was always 'famous' for poor reception" and Bill Giles, who recalled getting "lots of static" which made his attempts to record the show "more frustrating than satisfying".  After explaining that "This show is a good deal shorter than the other performances on the tour" because the band was allowed only a "three-hour time slot", the author writes that "There is nothing qualitative missing: performance and song selection are otherwise typical of the tour, which is to say brilliant, passionate, inspired, free of major train wrecks, and completely committed to both the songs and the jams."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 18: Kongressaal, Munich, West Germany (5/18/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 5/18/72 Blair Jackson starts with the claim that "One of the most-quoted remarks about the Europe '72 tour is Phil's admiring comment that Bill Kruetzmann 'played like a young god!' "  She then devotes most of her contribution to detailing why this is "So true" by telling, for example, of how "Bill is right on top of" the changes in tempo in "Jack Straw", and how "On 'El Paso,' his drums cut up the tune's fast waltz time into little bursts of cowboy gunfire", and describing "Bill's whip-cracking stick work" as someone who is "battering his toms and cymbals like a man possessed".  Jackson closes by noting the audience "is then treated to one of just two double encores on the Europe tour, with Merle Haggard's 'Sing Me Back Home' bittersweet touch" and "another kick-out-the-jams 'Saturday Night,' Billy as fresh and full of invntion as he was more than three hours earlier."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 19: Lyceum Theatre, London, England (5/23/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 5/23/1972 Sam Cutler opens by contrasting the Lyceum with the Wembley Empire Pool, the first venue on the tour, and describing this venue as "A small, 2,500-seat venue slap in the middle of London, built as a theatre in the late-19th century", which "was exactly the right venue" for the occasion.  Describing it as "all gold leaf and crumbling wallpaper" with a staff "in bow ties and maroon jackets" and "run with [British stiff-upper-lip|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_upper_lip] military precision", he asserts it was the perfect place for the Dead to "reduce to a more relaxed form of chaos where everyone could have a California version of anarchic fun."  After naming and acknowledging the individuals in the European Promoters Group who "took a chance" and helped organize the tour of a band "they had heard but never seen", Cutler closes his piece by asking "What can one say about the music?" and then answering his question with "There is nothing like a Grateful Dead concert."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 20: Lyceum Theatre, London, England (5/24/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 5/24/1972 Chris Jones gives a very personal account of having seen many shows at the venue before seeing the Dead there, and of how, although he "was an inexperienced taper and did all the wrong things", he would use a cassette tape recorder to record this and other shows he would go to, including the band's earlier shows at the Wembley Pool and Bickershaw.  Having attended the first three of the Dead's four shows at the Lyceum, he claims that they "are still, almost 40 years later, my favourite gigs of all time."  After describing the "huge piles of freebies we could help ourselves to by the side doors", Jones admits that although "the only thing I can remember of the music is that the band was brilliant" he still regrets not seeing the fourth show, and that "Those gigs on the Europe tour were so remarkable that they left me a confirmed and committed Dead Head."

In the liner notes for the show on 5/25/1972 [Alex Allan|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Allan#Personal_life] starts off by writing that after being "knocked out by seeing the Dead for the first time live at Bickershaw" he "went to all the Lyceum shows&mdash;taking time off from Cambridge University to drive up to London."  Writing that "''Live/Dead'' had been a revelation" and that he'd "lapped up their studio recordings too", he adds that the shows were "a great experience, especially on a tour when they were playing with such energy".  Regarding the show on the 25th, Allan claims that "the amazing 'Dark Star' in the second set" was most memorable and that it "seemed to go on forever", then closes his notes by revealing his only regret is that, after returning to Cambridge, he missed seeing the band "when they reportedly stopped off their bus to see King's College Chapel, right next door to my college rooms in Cambridge."
