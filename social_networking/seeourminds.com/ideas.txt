Team Building
- well-rounded teams
- need to cover all four functions to some extent
- evidence: my site (not very pragmatic)
- would like to test this idea for a few small teams (for a very low price, perhaps even for free)

Feel like I should address possible nay-sayers up front from the start.
If someone posts a hostile comment, just post url to this article (try to minimize the time spent worrying about it).

Idea: Series of three *short* articles
Format:
1. I have done this __________
2. The Good/Bad/Ugly thing is ____________
3. Result: I will be keeping on keeping on.

The Good:
I want to help people see past the surface.
I love to draw personalities, and have written a program to help me do this.

The Bad:
I want to help people see past the surface.
Not everyone gets this.
To understand it requires a little bit of "work."

The Ugly:
I want to help people see past the surface.
Many people like to see only the surface, not past it, and some will undoubtedly feel offended by my desire to see past it.
Moreover, I believe that some people feel the need to insult others and their work to
subconsciously compensate for some perceived lack in themself, e.g., their inability to see past the surface, and
perhaps even their failure to think about seeing past it before finding one of my spiritual portraits online.

Ultimately, one way or the other, it's a new spin on an age-old trope: one perceived insult leads to a counter attack,
soon both parties spiral into a bottomless pit of complete negativity.
As an idealist, I try my best to refrain from that sort of senseless behavior, and
 it's a complete waste of my time to try to educate a complete stranger who has no desire to learn.
In other words, some people have no desire to acknowledge the existence of Kandinsky's triangle,
 much less participate in the movement of it toward it's ultimate destination.
Yes people like this do exist.  They have smart phones but no interest in being smart, being only interested in putting themselves above others in any way they can.
