== Enclosure ==

Included with the release is a single sheet folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure that fits snugly inside the CD case. The front of this enclosure duplicates the cover of the CD, and the back features a rectangular color photograph of the inside of the venue with the [[house lights]] on, after the sound system has been set up but before the audience has arrived.

Inside the enclosure, the two pages contain a single wide color photograph of the band on stage.  Above the band members and against a background of the lights above the stage is a list of the band's members along with credits for the release in the left-most column. Three lists of tracks on the three CDs, also against the lights above the stage, take up the three columns on the remaining page-and-a-half. Copyright information appears in fine print at the bottom of the far left side of the photo.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 17, 2000.</ref>
