==Enclosure==

Included with the release is a single sheet folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure.  The front duplicates the cover of the CD and the back contains a drawing of a dragon eating its tail against a background of clouds that merge with the clouds on the cover.

The two pages inside contain a wide black-and-white drawing of the venue by [[Alfred Meeson]].  Above this drawing, in the clouds, are lists of the contents of and credits for the release.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 7, &copy; 1997.</ref>
