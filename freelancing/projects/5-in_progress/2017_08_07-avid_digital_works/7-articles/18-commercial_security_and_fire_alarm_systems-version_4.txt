 Commercial Security Cameras

Introduction
The cost of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) security cameras continues to decline, making them easy to afford.
Developments in technology enable businesses to combine cameras with other security products to design and build a security system perfectly suited to the business' needs and budget.

You can rely on the 2D Electronics Design and Consulting Services Division to design and install a security system that fits both your needs and your budget.

Commercial Security
Business owners can implement measures such as the following to increase the security of their business:
  Video Monitoring: surveillance cameras
  Access Control: keyed and electronic locks
  Alarms: door and window alarms, and motion detectors

This article focuses on CCTV security cameras.

Security Camera Options
The wide variety of cameras available today gives business owners many options.
  Systems may be wired or wireless
  Cameras may be fixed or mobile, allowing an operator to tilt, pan, or zoom in
  High resolution streams offer more detail but require more storage space
  Low resolution streams offer less detail but also require less storage space
  Systems can be designed to work at night or in other conditions where the lighting is low
  Some applications may require systems to be covert or vandal resistant, or both
  Some options support the ability to supplement the feed with high-resolution photographs
  These high-resolution systems are capable of helping to identify culprits and can even read license plates
  Modern options allow business owners to view one or more feeds live on phone

Along with the cost associated with each of these options, each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

The experts at 2D Electronics can help you design a system customized to your specific needs and budget.

Modern CCTV Systems
As technological developments continue to be made in the industry, new features continue to appear in these camera systems.

Recording
Modern digital surveillance systems can "multiplex" the images from more than one source onto a single storage device.  This allows:
  Storing more visual streams on less disk space
  Accessing these streams simultaneously

Motion-activated cameras are also available, allowing for the storage of more streams in less space.
These cameras can be set up to record at higher resolutions when monitoring movement.

These cameras can also be set up to trigger alarms so that security personnel and business owners can see what is going on in real time.

Monitoring
All video cameras allow monitoring while recording.

Business owners typically want to monitor all entrances to the building, and entrances to inner rooms where additional security is warranted.
These systems should be set up to monitor both door and window access.

In addition to monitoring access, 2d Electronics can design and install security systems to handle other applications.
  Retail businesses typically want to monitor transactions
  Businesses may want to make a panic button available for people such as cashiers who handle money
  Some businesses may want to monitor the building's environment (e.g., temperature, humidity)
  Systems are also available to detect flooding

Having video monitoring in addition to any of these types of more specialized monitoring equiment gives the business owner a more complete sense of what is going on and when.

Communications
If your place of business stands unoccupied at any time, then you will want to be notified immediately when something is wrong.

This communication can take place using any of the following technoligies:
  A smart phone application
  Text (SMS) mesage
  Email
  Phone call from an authorized security person
  Any combination of these

The Latest Technology
Leading-edge technology supports facial recognition and can even track movement with multiple cameras through Video Content Analysis (VCA).
This equipment can be set up to work with motion detectors so the cameras are unobtrusive and "come alive" only when an intruder is present.
