Part 5: Team Building Step 3 (Optional): Action
===============================================
This step is optional.
If all four personality traits are covered by the current team members, there is no need to change that.

I Would Prefer to Work With Growing Teams

I Am Against Firing People
I am definitely against firing people!
I would hate to be responsible for someone getting fired because they are part of a silo
(excess of a single type).
So I have no desire to work with teams that are not looking to add people.

My Personal Recommendation
- Know your type, know your strengths
- Figure out how to find freelancing work
- Realize that there is no such thing as a "permanent position"

I Would Prefer to Work With Small Teams
Naturally it would be easiest to test out my theory on small teams, four people max.
These people would have to embrace their own preference and respect the other team members' preferences.

I would like to test this idea of building a psychologically diverse team on a few small teams other than my own.
This would be for a very low price, perhaps even for free (e.g., if you're already a friend of mine irl).
If you would be interested in participating in this pilot program, please contact me!

This step contains the following sub-steps:

(1) Figure out what type of person you want to hire to cover the four basic functions
(2) Figure out how to hire that type of person

This is outside my area of expertise.

However, if you agree that hiring based on internal rather than external characteristics,
I would hope that it opens up the candidate pool for you!

It's impossible to estimate how long each of these sub-steps will take
without information about the team dynamics and what changes are desired.
