Mom's Story
-----------
My Mom got her undergraduate degree from <a href='https://wp.stolaf.edu/' title='St. Olaf College home page' target='_blank'>St. Olaf College</a>.
She met my father and they married in the early 1950s.

After their marriage ended, she worked her way through Graduate School and got a Master's degree in Psychiatric Nursing.
She then started working at <a href='https://bonsecours.com/richmond/find-a-facility/st-marys-hospital' title='St. Mary's Hospital home page' target='_blank'>St. Mary's Hospital</a> as a psychiatric nurse.

My parents' divorce was very acrimonious.
I can't help but wonder whether that had something to do with their personality types being so similar?
Certainly there were many factors at work here, and moreover, it's best to try to just move on.

My Mom remarried.
I was able to get my step-dad to take the quiz and he turned out to be an ESTJ.
They were much happier together, so based on this extremely small &mdash; yet very important, to me &mdash; data set, I can theorize that relationships work better when there's only one idealist (i.e., i<q>N</q>tuitive type).


Dad's Story

My Dad got his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill <a href='https://www.unc.edu/' title='Home page of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill' target='_blank'>(UNC)</a>.
He met my mother and they married in the early 1950s.

He first worked at <a href='http://www.texaco.com/' title='Home page of texaco.com' target='_blank'>Texaco</a> and then at <a href='http://www.altria.com/our-companies/philipmorrisusa/Pages/default.aspx' title='Home page of Phillip Morris' target='_blank'>Phillip Morris</a> as a research chemist.

Their divorce was very acrimonious.

My Dad remarried, and my step-mom refused to take the quiz but I suspect she was an ESTJ or an ESFJ &mdash; definitely more <q>normal</q> than me.

My Story
--------
Growing up in Richmond, VA in the 1960s meant watching assassinations, riots and a war on TV, and listening to The Beatles.
We could drink 3.2 beer on our 18th birthday, whoo-hoo!

With that teenage feeling of immortality combined with the impending doom of the Cold War hanging over our heads, it was a good time to smoke cigarettes.  In Richmond in those days, they were 25 cents a pack.  There were friends, beer and The Grateful Dead, and work and school.

I worked my way through school, sometimes at part-time jobs, and sometimes at full-time jobs.
During this time, I had full-time jobs at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Overnite-Transportation/163666416984656' title='Facebook page for Overnite Transportation' target='_blank'>Overnite Transportation</a>, <a href='http://www.richmondgov.com/' title='Home page of The City of Richmond VA' target='_blank'>The City of Richmond VA</a>, and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Virginia' title='Wikipedia page for The Bank of Virginia' target='_blank'>The Bank of Virginia</a>.

I got my B.S. in Math (Computer Science) and a Masters of Interdisciplinary Studies from Virginia Commonwealth University
<a href='https://www.vcu.edu/' title='Home page of Virginia Commonwealth University' target='_blank'>(VCU)</a>.

My parents' divorce was very acrimonious.
