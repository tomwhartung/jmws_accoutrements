===''Europe '72, Vol. 1: Wembley Empire Pool, London, England (4/7/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/7/1972 Gary Lambert sets the scene by writing that "the Dead were overshandowed by ''the'' pop culture story in the U.K. at the time, a fleeing craze known as '[Bolan Mania|https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bolanmania&redirect=no]'".  The author goes on to discuss the "[symbiosis|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis] between the U.S. and U.K rock scenes", and quotes "the great British playwright [Tom Stoppard|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Stoppard]" as saying "Everybody had a sense of that".  Lambert then details how "The first shows were scheduled for April 5-8 at the 3,000-seat [Rainbow Theatre|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Theatre]," then moved to "the Commodore in King Street, Hammersmith, instead of the now closed Rainbow Theatre" and then ultimately "turned into two at the building today known as the [12,000-plus-capacity] [Wembley Arena|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Arena], then called Empire Pool", before closing this contribution with "To be continued on 4/8/72. . ." [elipsis in original].

===''Europe '72, Vol. 2: Wembley Empire Pool, London, England (4/8/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/8/1972 Gary Lambert starts off by quoting [Sam Cutler|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cutler]'s introduction of the band on 4/7/72 and continues building on his notes for the previous show by stating "Sam's instincts proved correct: while no one expected the Dead to fill the Empire Pool, they drew more than respectably&mdash;somwhere in the neighborhood of 8,000 paying customers each night".  Lambert then describes the two nights at the venue as if they were one long show, writing that "By midway through the second set on opening night ... all notions of 'British reserve' were clearly out the window" and "on Night Two in London" the Dead took "an even more fearless dive into the deep unreal".  In the closing paragraph, the author revisits the topic he opened with in his previous piece, writing that "In the edition of [Melody Maker|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody_Maker] immediately following the Empire Pool shows, even 'Bolan Mania' had taken a backseat: most of the front page was devoted to a huge picture of Garcia and his new customized Stratocaster, accompanied by a headline reading [in all caps] 'Dead storm Britain'."
