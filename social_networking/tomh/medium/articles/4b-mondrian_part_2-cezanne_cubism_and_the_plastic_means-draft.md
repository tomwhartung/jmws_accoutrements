Time to take the basic ideas I have for this new article on medium and turn them into a draft.

**Try to keep it short and sweet -- and focused on explaining the term "plastic."**

#### LOL as if!  But try to stay on track!!

## [Introduction -- implied rather than stated]

There are two kinds of art: mimetic and cathartic.
The difference between them is the way and the extent to which the artist uses the *plastic means.*

I learned about these two types of art only recently, in a class at [edx.org](https://edx.org) entitled [Art and Design in the Digital Age](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:IsraelX+DIGITALARTx+1T2021/home).
The class is quite enlightening, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys learning about the history of art.

Mimetic art is representational, and the artist seeks to mimic reality.
Cathartic art is expressionist, and the artist seeks to express how they feel about reality.

## Part 2 of a Series

This is part 2 of a series of articles about the work of the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian, 1872-1944.
For part 1 see [The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian, Part 1: Equilibrium in Art and Life](https://medium.com/@tomwhartung/the-prophetic-vision-of-piet-mondrian-part-1-equilibrium-in-art-and-life-c2b7ba006fd5).

The image above is a poster of a painting Mondrian completed in 1922 entitled *Composition 2.*
It is typical of Mondrian's distinctive style, which he called *[NeoPlasticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasticism)* or *The New Plastic.*

You can buy a poster of an image like this from the site [art.com](https://www.art.com/gallery/id--a7/piet-mondrian-posters.htm) for around $100 to $200,
and find originals similar to it on the site [sothebys.com](https://www.sothebys.com/en/artists/piet-mondrian) for around $2,000,000 to over $30,000,000.
The fact that Mondrian's Neoplastic paintings, which are now around 100 years old, sell for such large amounts is proof that his vision was truly prophetic.

Although Mondrian's work is valuable today, he lived humbly.
According to the *Chronology* in his *Collected Writings,* at times he had to supplement "his small income by painting watercolors of flowers" [p. xxii, 1922].

Also from his *Collected Writings* is this quote, from a letter he wrote to Arnold Saalborn around 1910:

> But since I do not earn much with "my kind of work," I also have to devote a great deal of time to work for the mass, that is,
> a more conventional manner of painting -- so I have to work twice as much [p. 19].

In trying to understand Mondrian's art, I've spent a considerable amount of time reading his *Collected Writings* -- parts of which can be quite challenging to understand.
One of the reasons it can be difficult to understand his writings is that he frequently uses the word *plastic,* in expressions such as *plastic means,* *plastic expression,* and *plastic value.*

The focus of this article is on how I learned what Mondrian meant by the word *plastic.*

This quest first lead to learning about Cubism, which inspired Mondrian's unique style.
That in turn lead to learning about Paul Cézanne, who in turn inspired the Cubists.
It was in a book about Cézanne's compositions that I finally found a definition of *the plastic means.*

## Piet Mondrian's *Collected Writings*

*[The New Art -- The New Life, The Collected Writings of Piet Mondrian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13291.The_New_Art_the_New_Life)*
is a book edited and translated by [Henry Holtzman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Holtzman) and [Martin S. James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_S._James).
Mondrian's writings appear in the book in chronological order, which was first published in 1986.

The authors divide the book into three parts.

- Part I, *The De Stijl Years: 1917-24,* covers his writings for the journal *De Stijl.*
- Part II, *After De Stijl: 1924-1938,* contains the pieces he wrote after he and *De Stijl* parted ways but was still in continental Europe.
- Part III, *England and the United States: 1938-1944,* includes the articles and essays he wrote after leaving continental Europe due to the impending war.

One of the pieces in this book is *The New Art -- The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships,* which Mondrian first completed in December, 1931.
It appears in Part II of the book and the authors undoubtedly refer to it in the title of his *Collected Writings* because it draws parallels between his art and society at large, making it one of his most enlightening pieces.

Mondrian calls the piece a "little work into which I have compressed all that I believe and hope for" [p. 245] in a letter to Alfred Roth dated August 6, 1931.
In this "little work" he discusses concepts such as "equivalent relationships" [e.g., p. 248, p. 251], "individual liberty" and "independent existence" [p. 255], and "freedom from the oppression of particular form" [p. 263].

Near the end of the piece he predicts that his art, and that by others, can and will eventually lead to "high universal morality -- the true content of love, friendship, brotherhood, and all their synonyms" [p. 271].

In the past I've checked out copies of this book from the library, and read the articles and essays somewhat randomly, picking out those with the most interesting-sounding titles.
Recently I obtained my very own copy of this book, and decided to take a more methodical approach, starting with the introductory material by the authors and reading the articles in chronological order.

At this point I've finished all of Part I, which spans 183 pages -- almost half of the book's total of 410 pages -- and bits and pieces of Parts II and III.

## Plastic Means Versus Plastic Material

Throughout his writings Mondrian frequently uses the term "plastic."
As mentioned above, he refers to the style of his work as the "New Plastic" or "Neo-Plasticism," and this term appears in the title of many of his articles.

In fact, Mondrian called his first book -- which was published as a collection of essays in the journal *De Stijl* -- *The New Plastic in Painting.*
He began writing it in 1914, and it appeared in twelve installments in the journal between October 1917 and October 1918.

While reading his *Collected Writings,* I have found the term "plastic" to be a constant mental stumbling block.
It is clear from the context that when Mondrian uses the word he is *not* referring to the ubiquitous plastic material used to make many of today's products.

Context makes it somewhat clear that he uses the word "plastic" to refer to the way he constructs and composes his images -- the way he molds reality into shapes of his own choosing.
For example, one of the chapters in this first series of articles, *New Plastic in Painting,* is entitled *The New Plastic as Abstract-Real Painting: Plastic Means and Composition.*

The [wikipedia page for Neoplasticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasticism) hints at this idea, stating that "every artist manipulates reality to produce an aesthetically pleasing, artfully pleasing whole."
This gives us a sense of what he meant by the term, but it would be nice to see an actual definition of it and not have to wonder and guess.

## Plastic This, Plastic That

In the first twelve paragraphs of his "little work" *The New Art -- The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships,* Mondrian uses the term fifteen times!
In each of these occurrences the word appears with a qualifier:

- "plastic means" occurs 7 times
- "plastic expression" occurs 5 times
- "plastic value" occurs 3 times

I believe the counts from these twelve paragraphs are representative of the relative frequency with which he uses these short phrases in the rest of the book.
That is, my impression is that he mentions the "plastic means" more frequently than he does any of the other pairs.

In this example, from the eighth paragraph of *The New Art -- The New Life,* he uses the word "plastic" with all three of these qualifiers:

> If purely *plastic expression* is created by "the relationships" of line, plane surface, and color in their purely *plastic values,* then these means exist only through their relationships.
> Therefore, relationships are just as important as the *plastic means.*  [p. 246, the quotes appear in the original, but I added the italics to highlight the word in question].

One of the reasons I decided to read his writings in chronological sequence is that I was hoping to find a definition of the term, or at least learn to be more comfortable with it when I encountered it.
Naturally, if one wants to learn something, it makes sense to start at the beginning!

Unfortunately -- as far as I can tell from reading a bit more than the first half of the book, anyway -- he never really defines the term.
The closest thing to a definition I have found so far is this circular definition appearing in his 1930 essay *Cubism and Neo-Plastic:*

> By pure plastic we mean the plastic of relationships alone, expressed by line and color also alone, that is to say, without any limited form.  [p. 237].

Again, although it obviously has something to do with composition, I was never really 100% sure what he meant by it.
Moreover, despite having a sense of what he meant, it would be nice to be sufficiently comfortable with the term to be able to confidently and competently explain it to somone.

As I went through his articles and essays, it became more and more clear that I needed to back up to and learn about the artists who inspired Mondrian: the Cubists and their progenitor, Paul Cézanne.

## Mondrian's Inspiration: Cubism

In their introductory pieces, Holtzman and James discuss how Cubism influenced Mondrian's early work.

For those unfamiliar with Cubism, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque were, along with Cézanne, the progenitors of the style.
This image, Picasso's *Harlequin* of 1918, is an excellent example of a Cubist painting.

- Image:

![../images/mondrian_part_2-harlequin-1918.jpg](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_accoutrements/blob/master/social_networking/tomh/medium/images/mondrian_part_2-harlequin-1918.jpg)

- Source: [wikiart.org](https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cubism?select=featured)

In an essay entitled *Piet Mondrian: The Man and His Work,* coauthor Harry Holtzman introduces the *Collected Works,* by writing:

> Mondrian saw Cubism as the new awareness of the intrinsic means of plastic expression, as the destruction of the naturalistic and the mimetic, as the conscious
> construction of the picure-plane, as the dynamic rhythm of its composition of forms in space.  [p. 8.]

And in his introductory essay *Piet Mondrian: Art and Theory to 1917,* coauthor of the *Collected Works* Martin James writes:

> Cubism, Mondrian repeatedly stressed, opened the way for the New Plastic.  Shortly after seeing examples of early Cubist work by Picasso and Braque at the Monderne
> Kunstkring in late 1911, he settled in Paris.  His analytical Cubist "compositions" of 1912-13 in grays and browns were based on a favorite motif, the tree, where
> particular forms disappear almost completely in the whole.  [p. 14.]

To be honest, despite being a life-long student of Art History, I never really understood Cubism.
As it turns out, when it comes to understanding these paintings, a little information from the right source can go a long way.

The paintings may seem to be a bit "crazy," but it turns out there is a method to their "madness!"

At one point I put Mondrian's book aside and started reading Douglas Cooper's book *[The Cubist Epoch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/552681.The_Cubist_Epoch),* published in 1971.
Cooper's book in turn frequently refers to the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, who wrote and published *[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cubist_Painters,_Aesthetic_Meditations)*
between 1905 and 1913.

In this short book Apollinaire claims the goal of the Cubist painters is to "encompass past, present and future in a single glance"
[p. 8 of the 2004 translation by Peter Read and published by the University of California Press].
This explains very concisely why these paintings appear so fractured and "crazy:" Picasso, Braque, and the other Cubists deliberately sought to capture multiple points-of-view of their subjects
from different points in time, all in a single image.

Realizing that in the early 1900s painters found themselves in competition with photographers and filmmakers helps explain their interest in this sort of style.

At one point, Apollinaire explains Cubism by comparing the paintings to music:

> When he listens to a concert, the music-lover experiences joyful feelings which are different from the joy experienced when he hears natural sounds like the murmur of a stream,
> the roar of a waterfall, the wind soughing through a forest, or the harmonies of human speech, based on reason and not on aesthetics.
> Similarly, the new painters will provide their admirers with artistic sensations created only by the harmony of contrasting hues of light [p. 12 of the 2004 translation by Peter Read].

In other words, a musician seeking to mimic nature and create representational works would produce sounds corresponding to those we hear in nature.
Instead, most musicians seek catharsis and want to express themselves, so they play instruments built specifically for the sole purpose of playing melodies based on pure notes.

In this light, the Cubists were just trying to catch up with musicians by doing their own thing and expressing their inner vision.

A bit later in *The Cubist Painters* Apollinaire asserts that the Cubist style permits the artists "to give the object proportions appropriate to the *degree of plasticity* he desires" [p. 16, emphasis added].

There's that word again!

## My Interest in All This

As I learned about Cubism, I started thinking that it would be a great style to adopt for the next phase of my own Art Project, which entails visualizing personalities.

Mondrian's work -- which is based on opposites of color and form -- served as a major inspiration for the first phase of this project, which depicts the opposites Carl Jung describes in his
*[General Description of the Types](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Jung/types.htm).*
In the early-to-mid 1900s Isabel Briggs-Myers codified Jung's work in this area of psychology and created the Myers Briggs Type Indicator or [MBTI (r)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator),
which people can use to find their four-letter personality type.

I first learned about the MBTI in the 1980s -- right around the time I learned about Modern Art and Mondrian -- and learning that I am an INFP turned out to be life-altering!
Today, high schools and colleges teach courses explaining these four-letter types, books about them are popular, and posts with hashtags such as #intj and #enfp that reference them are
easy to find on social media sites such as twitter, pinterest, reddit, and tumblr.

INFP stands for Introverted, iNtuitive, Feeling, and Perceptive.
I feel a strong connection to Piet Mondrian, and suspect he is, like me, an INFP, but pursuing that idea will have to wait.

Recently I decided to base the next phase of my visualizing personalities on the Big Five "OCEAN" personality traits, and have been researching that model of personality
in parallel with my studies of Mondrian and Cubism.
Reading *The Cubist Epoch* and learning about how the various Cubist artists and their paintings evolved over time, I started thinking this style -- which is more nuanced than Mondrian's Neo-Plasticism --
would be a great way to express these personality traits, which are more nuanced than Jung's personality types.

So taking this detour into understanding Cubism has been inspiring!

## The Cubists' Inspiration: Paul Cézanne

As I became increasingly interested in and inspired by the Cubists, I learned that these artists and their work were in turn inspired by the work of Paul Cézanne.
Indeed, *The Cubist Epoch* mentions him with about the same frequency as Mondrian mentions the "plastic means!"

After reading a few chapters of Cooper's book I eventually caved in to this curiosity, and searched for books about Cézanne in the Denver Public Library (DPL).
This was during the Coronovirus pandemic in 2020, so I had to put the seven books I found on hold and arrange to pick them via the DPL's curbside holds service.

These books are large and printed on high-quality paper, so they're very heavy.
When I went to pick them up it took two people to carry them all out to my car!

It was in one of these books that I finally found a definition of the term "plastic means."

## The Plastic Means: Defined and Illustrated!

Most of the books about Cézanne that I found were either biographical in nature, or used critiques to expound on his place in Art history, or both.

However, one of the books, *[Cézanne's Composition: Analysis of His Form With Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1199387.C_zanne_s_Composition)*
written by Erle Loran and published in 1943, did not fit into this mold.
It was in Loran's book that I finally found a formal definition of "the plastic means."
To say that I was excited is a bit of an understatement!

Loran's book is divided into sections rather than chapters, and Section III (of XV), is named *An Illustrated Glossary.*
One typically finds a glossary of terms near the end of a book, but Loran's definitions come near the beginning: on page 17 (of 136).

Although it spans a mere 8 pages, Loran's *Illustrated Glossary* contains 22 diagrams.
The diagrams are fairly simple sketches in black-and-white, but they are invaluable for someone wanting to understand terms such as "plastic means."

Following is Loran's definition of *the plastic means or plastic form,* which appears early in the *Illustrated Glossary:*

> THE PLASTIC MEANS or PLASTIC FORM are terms used often in the present study, and are given a connotation different from that made familiar in
> art criticism and art history in general.  The traditional connotation implies sculptural roundness as achieved through light-and-shade modeling
> and chiaroscuro.  In this book the term *sculptural effect* is used when roundness is implied.  On the contrary, the term *plastic means*
> connotes three-dimensional space in general.  Diagram II [the "picture box" below] is intended as a compendium of the plastic field for
> Cezanne's picture shown in Plate VII.  All the diagrams in the Glossary deal with various aspects of the plastic means.  The sum of all
> the diagrams for Plates I and X constitute the analysis of the plastic means that Cezanne has used in creating these paintings.  Thus
> line, plane, volume, color, texture, and so on, are the plastic means used to build and organize the total space in the picture plane.
> Hence plastic qualities are not only three-dimensional, but two-dimensional as well.  [p. 18, emphasis in original as italics].

- Source: [Cézanne's Composition by Erle Loran,](https://archive.org/details/cezannescomposit0000lora_f9b1) p. 17.

The sketch of the "picture box" above is the "Diagram II" Loran refers to in his definition, and it shows the motif for Cézanne's 1897 painting *House and Farm at Jas de Bouffan.*
This house is "the Cézanne family's country estate," and a black-and-white reproduction of it appears on page 53 as Plate VII, which is also mentioned in his definition.

Following is a copy of the painting in color.

- Image:

![`../images/mondrian_part_2-cezanne-house_and_farm_at_jas_de_bouffan-1887.jpg`](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_accoutrements/blob/master/social_networking/tomh/medium/images/mondrian_part_2-cezanne-house_and_farm_at_jas_de_bouffan-1887.jpg)

- Source: [wikiart.org](https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/house-and-farm-at-jas-de-bouffan-1887)

Loran's full definition is a bit much, and although he claims that it differs from "the traditional connotation," it looks to be relevant to Mondrian's use of the term nonetheless.
Importantly, because Mondrian was not a sculptor, and the paintings we're interested in do not contain rounded shapes, it sounds like Mondrian's use of the term does not constitute "the traditional connotation."
So it looks like we are on the right track!

This sentence, from near the end of his definition, contains the key idea we're looking for:

> Thus line, plane, volume, color, texture, and so on, are the *plastic means used to build and organize the total space in the picture plane* [p. 18, emphasis added].

It turns out that, although my guess regarding the meaning of the term as being, kinda sorta, the "compositon of a painting" was fuzzy, I was pretty close!

## The Plastic Means Versus Scientific Perspective

Loran's book includes photographs of Cézanne's motifs, and there are two photographs of this one in section VII, *Problems of Perspective* on page 52.
The two photographs of this motif included in Loran's book are not the best, and he admits they "make the disappointing and prosaic truth clear enough" [p. 53].

Most importantly, in the photographs the house does not look like it is ready to tip over!
Loran writes that this "leftward-leaning axis of the house may be understood as a distortion that increases the tension of the house in relation to the four sides of the frame" [p. 53].

To my eyes, this tipping of the axes makes the painting come alive.  It seems funny somehow!

For Loran, it "has always suggested to me the setting for a melodramatic scene in a Dostoievski novel".
He goes on to claim "the window shapes, giving a somewhat haunted or deserted aspect to the scene, also contribute to the dramatic effect" [p. 53].

Apparently where Loran is disposed to see scenes from *Notes From Underground* and *Crime and Punishment,* I'm more influenced by shows like *Parks and Recreation,* *Friends,* and *The Office.*

The author describes how the shapes take the viewer's eyes on a circular, clockwise path from the bottom of the image, to the house on the left and then up to its roof, and finally to the smaller buildings on the right.
He concludes his analysis by writing "the real drama in the painting derives from the plastic forces" [p. 54] that control our attention.

Given Loran's definition of the plastic means, his sketch of the picture box in Diagram II, Cézanne's rendering of the motif, and the fact that the house is not actually leaning in real life, we can start to understand
the "plastic means" as essentially the way a painter interprets or projects three-dimensional subject matter onto the two dimensions of the picture plane.

Having had a sense that this was what Mondrian means by the term "plastic means," upon reading this book -- and most importantly seeing the images in it -- I finally started feeling like I really understood the term.

## More Paintings and Photographs of the Motifs

The bulk of *Cézanne's Composition* contains plates of Cézanne's paintings juxtaposed with sketches and text that analyze his compositions.
When possible -- that is, when the paintings are of landscapes rather than portraits -- Loran includes photographs of the motifs in the paintings.

Following are two images from page 60 of Loran's book: a copy of Cézanne's painting *[The Sainte Victoire, Seen From the Quarray Called Bibemus](paulcezanne.org/mont-sainte-victoire-seen-from-the-bibemus-quarry.jsp)*
in black-and-white, and a black-and-white photograph of the motif by Loran.
Given these images, one does not really need to read Loran's analysis to get a full appreciation for why Cézanne is widely heralded as the
[Father of Modern Art](https://smithsonianassociates.org/ticketing/tickets/cezanne-father-of-modern-art).

- Image:

![`../images/mondrian_part_2-sainte_victoire-both-bw-p_60-scaled-2-cropped-1.jpg`](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_accoutrements/blob/master/social_networking/tomh/medium/images/mondrian_part_2-sainte_victoire-both-bw-p_60-scaled-2-cropped-1.jpg)

- Source: [Cézanne's Composition](https://archive.org/details/cezannescomposit0000lora_f9b1) by Erle Loran, p. 60.

Seeing these images side-by-side is extremely enlightening!
In describing these images, Loran writes:

> Cézanne has more than doubled the size of the Sainte Victoire.  The illusion of magnificent height which Cézanne has achieved through these measurable
> *plastic means* is akin to the exaggerated sense of its height that one has on actually seeing it -- as I had when I first discovered the motif.  But
> the photograph of the motif utterly fails to suggest the grandeur, the massiveness, of this luminous white mountain....
> Cézanne's painting, as compared with the [photograph of the] motif, illustrates graphically what should be understood and taught more widely as the
> basic mechanics of drawing and composition, the *fundamental plastic means of expression.* [p. 60, emphasis added].

Loran goes on to assert that the painting "becomes a new reality achieved by purely plastic means, by color and form alone" [p. 61].
His use of the term *plastic* in these comparisons of the painting and his photograph really leave no doubt as to what he means by the term!

Cézanne created a [series of paintings of the Sainte Victoire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Sainte-Victoire_(C%C3%A9zanne)), and Loran includes a few of these in his book.
In each case he includes a photograph of the motif showing how Cézanne's interpretation differed from a scientific perspective of the mountain.

This version from the quarry is the only one of Cézanne's paintings to appear in color in Loran's book, and he uses it to conduct an extended analysis of the artist's use of color.

- Source: Cézanne's Composition by Erle Loran, p. 60.

In his analysis of this painting Loran writes that "Cézanne's uniqueness and perhaps his historical greatness is found in his power to synthesize abstraction and reality" [p. 63].
A full discussion of his analysis is far beyond the scope of this article, but I encourage anyone interested in a deep dive into Cézanne's use of color to find a copy of the book!

Published in 1943, *Cézanne's Composition* is apparently out of print.
Although it costs $75-100 on [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/C%C3%A9zannes-Composition-Analysis-Diagrams-Photographs/dp/0520248457),
you can read it for free on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/cezannescomposit0000lora_f9b1), simply by creating a free account on the site.

## Plasticism and Malleability

At this point I finally feel as though I could explain *the plastic means* to someone -- albeit perhaps in halting terms along with a bit of hand-waving -- and a lot more easily if I could refer to these images!
What the *plastic means* and *plastic material* share is the concept of *malleability.*

Plastic bags are handy precisely because they can take on any shape needed to hold our purchases.
It's easy to see why manufacturers often prefer plastic to the more traditional and less malleable materials like wood or steel.

Piet Mondrian took what Cézanne and the Cubists started to its logical conclusion, often foregoing representation entirely, and calling the resultant style *Neo-Plasticism.*


-------- So far, so good. -------

## Digital Plasticity

[Possibly off-topic, but thinking about mentioning plasticity today: cell phone cameras, Star Wars, GoT, etc. maybe?]

## Mimesis and Representation versus Catharsis and Expression

Two different kinds of art.

## Conclusion

It's difficult to find a definition of the word "plastic" that corresponds to Mondrian's use of the word.

Indeed, the index to the book Vision in Motion by L. Moholy-Nagy (1961) lists 19 occurrences of the term, but only the first mimics Mondrian's use of the term, while the other 18 references are to the material.

If you are interested in the language of composition in general, and in reading Mondrian's writings in particular, I highly recommend finding a copy of Erle Loran's book!


-------- delete me, you wuss. -------

## Cubism Inspired, Cubism Adjacent

[Possibly off-topic, but thinking about including something about Mondrian being included in Cooper's book, and also mentioning Duchamp and the Orphists, as being others who were not Cubists, but were inspired about them.]
