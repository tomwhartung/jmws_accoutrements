If I want to collect email addresses, and be more professional, and cover my butt better,
I need to state my Terms of Service.

Yikes (I could get sued) and hmm (more stuff to learn about) and ugh (legalese, ugh).

## Requirements

- The Terms of Service must be general yet specific enough to use on any of my sites
- The Terms of Service should allow for:
  - Affiliate marketing
  - Displaying AdSense ads
  - Building a list of fans' email addresses
