Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. RESS
--------------------------------
If responsive works for you, go for it.

As mobile bloat increases, though, how long will that last?

If you need to use device detection:

o  RESS - using a combo technique, is best.

o  Allow easily switching between multiple options

o  Fail gracefully - have a reasonable default for unrecognized devices

o  For the sake of users' data plans, please don't send a lot of contetnt to phones only to hide it
   I feel tablets are a different matter, and it's fine to group them with desktops, because both are more likely to be connected via wifi

o  For the sake of the developers, keep it as simple as possible

Using Adaptive on its own, without using any Responsive techniques, seems to be best suited to simpler sites, e.g., SPAs such as my resume.

Drupal!
-------

Having built-in caching is a huge distinguishing feature of Drupal, but increases the complexity of implementing something like this properly.

Happy to have learned a bit about Drupal - to have gotten my feet wet so to speak.

Drupal is definitely the most complicated of the CMSes and it changes very quickly.

After just a little experience with it, it is easy to see why the people who use it don't have time to play around with the others
