Having given it some thought, I have decided to write multiple articles about Mondrian's vision, with each focused on a single aspect.

This file contains some thoughts about the series, for future consideration.

# Goal - The Big Picture

To be able to reference this article in subsequent articles, about how Mondrian has influenced my personal vision over the years.

## The First and Subsequent Parts

At this time, only the content of the first part is certain:

- The first part will focus on equilibrium.
- Possible idea for a second part: Mondrian's *Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow* represents equilibrium between
the various gods or religions or both
- At minimum, there will be at least one part on high universal morality.

At this time I am unsure whether there will be more than these two-or-three parts.
Ponder!  Think!  Incubate!

# Ideas

## Songs

I sometimes like to put Easter-eggy-type links to songs in my articles.  It's a thing.

- What's So Funny 'Bout Peace Love and Understanding
- Love Is All You Need
- Love Is All Is Alright (High Universal Morality)

## My Point

I like Mondrian's idealism and want to contribute to the awareness of the need for more
equlibrium and desire for equivalent relationships.

Or something like that.

## My Take

### Ideas I Like:

- Equilibrium in general
- Equivalent mutual relationships in particular
- Purified forms - in art, people, and society
- Learning about and revealing inner traits and energies
- Honesty

### Parallels With Archetypes

- Breaking things down into essential elements (N/S and F/T) so that we can see them
- Removing distracting surface shit

### Obvious but Important

One can't create the same sort art that Mondrian created, for that would not be art.

# The Articles

## Titles

Titles should follow this format:

- The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian, Part X: [Specific Topic Covered in the Article]

For example:

- The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian, Part 1: Equilibrium in Art and Life
- The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian, Part 2: Equilibrium in Religion (proposed)
- The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian, Part 3: High Universal Morality (proposed)

That may be too long, and may need to be split into a title and subtitle, as appropriate.

## Possible Abstractions to Discuss in the Articles

#### Abstractions in Religion

One might say that gods are the ultimate abstractions.

This could make a nice **short** article with a broad appeal!  **Keep it short though!**

It sucks that differences of specifics - "particular forms" - are the source of so much violence!

#### Abstractions in Math and Science

Formulas - V = IR (Ohm's law) - describes the flow of electrons in everything electronic, from the 12 volts of direct current in cars, to
the 220 volts of alternating current in heavy appliances like air conditioners, washers and driers, to the
micro electronics in our smart phones and key fobs.

#### Abstractions in Art

Literature, poetry and music - anything with similies and metaphors - All Along the Watchtower ....
Dance - ballet - story abstracted to its essential elements and retold using the movements permitted by the dance.

[Business - organizational chart - (do I want this here, or in a separate section, or maybe just skip it?)]
[Even terms like bread, man, woman, dog, cat are abstractions in that they are only concepts unless they are qualified (e.g., my cat).]

#### Abstractions in Politics

- Countries: Declaration of Independence,
- Political Parties: Statement of Principles
- Manifestos

Assassinations can be "tricky," because they can turn popular leaders into martyrs.

It's much more difficult to kill an idea - an abstraction - than it is to kill a person.

#### BYO Specifics

The already-published articles in the files:
- `2?-music_and_abstract_art-article*`

in this directory cover this topic quite well.

They took a long time to write so definitely refer to them as necessary - that's why I wrote them!

### The Power of Intuition

[Abstracting processes - ideas: installing software, vacuuming, ???]

Subconscious processing - the "aha" we get when driving, mowing the lawn, washing dishes, taking a shower, etc.

### The New Art - The New Life

My main point and where we quote and explain only the best quotes....

### Possible Conclusion for One or More Articles

This short book was not published during his lifetime.
I believe this is because he was so far ahead of his time.
It is also so abstract that it is difficult to understand - even for me, and I love abstract stuff!
