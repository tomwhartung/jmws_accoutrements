There are many affiliate marketing opportunities in addition to those run by the assholes who rejected me.

# Fresh Resources

Googling for "best affiliate sites for books" and "best affiliate sites dvds" led me to the following sites:


## Specific Resources - To Come Back To

These sound interesting, but I am not sure whether I am ready to jump in right this second.

### Viglinks and Skimlinks

Appear in a couple of lists and it sounds like they are different and so one or both might be good,
maybe after getting going with a more traditional site such as CJ Affiliate.

### Target Affiliates

Mentioned in one list as good for beginners but in another says it doesn't pay much on books and dvds.

- http://affiliate.target.com/

### DVD Bundles

Not in the lists but found in the search results.

- http://dvdbundles.com/affiliates
- Looks interesting: "lucrative dvd affiliate program"
- 10% on each sale
- Also highlighted at http://www.affiliateguide.com/internettv.html

**Note: They use ShareASale.**


## Gleaned From the Lists

These appear in one or more of the lists below and look particularly interesting:

- CJ Affiliate - on many of the lists, already signed up, start here
- ShareASale - also on many of the lists
- VigLink - sounds quite intersting
- FlexOffers - on forexreferral's highest paying list
