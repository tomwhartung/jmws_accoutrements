# Log of Connectivity Issues Had Using Forethought.net

## Basic Connectivity Issues

### Thu. 2018-05-03:

- First started having issues with connectivity.
- Contacted forethought.net several times
- Forethought.net says the problem is the modem cannot see the MAC address of the router behind it
- Talked forethought.net into giving me a new modem, one of their choosing, to replace the one I bought at Microcenter last time I had issues.

### Fri. 2018-05-04:

- Installed new modem
- It took awhile to confirm all my sites were working properly
- Accessing tomhartung.com via my phone - without wifi from the LAN - it prompts me to log into the modem - which is scary!
- Accessing the ip 206.124.10.54 brings up prompt to log into the modem - which is scary!
- Discussed this with Forethought.net, and they said it should ot work that way, so I decided to check everything out from the library

### Sat. 2018-05-05:

- Went to the library to confirm all my sites were working properly from outside the LAN
- Looks good, everything seems to be working ok, did not get any prompts to log into the modem, even when using the IP address

### Mon. 2018-05-07:

- Started having connectivity issues again
- Called forethought.net
- They say the problem is still that the modem cannot see the MAC address of the router behind it
- They agreed to give me another new modem

### Tue. 2018-05-08:

- Told a new friend at Google I/O Extended about my site
- She tried to access it but of course couldn't, making me look very bad and surely damaging the first impression I have made on her
- After Google I/O Extended, stopped by forethoughtn.net and traded in the "old" modem from last week for a new one
- It doesn't work, rats, and they are already closed for the day

### Wed. 2018-05-09:

- Called forethought.net fairly early and we ran a few tests, unplugging the phone and everything, which apparently went Ok
- They sent me several screenshots of parameters used to set up a Comtrend modem that is somewhat similar to the Zhone modem they gave me
- It is difficult to see a parallel between the Comtrend modem in the screenshots and the Zhone modem I have
  - One issue is that it is difficult to see in the screenshots which option is currently selected
  - The navigation on the Zhone modem makes it obvious which option is currently selected
  - This could be much easier if they could be bothered to send screenshots matching the modem they gave me
  - This could be much easier if they could be bothered to supply detailed instructions on how to set up the modem
  - Having just finished re-reading "To Sell Is Human" by Daniel Pink, it is clear that forethought.net is doing *everything wrong here*
- Using my phone has pushed the data usage way up, resulting in a much higher bill next time
- At this point I am beginning to really lose my patience
- They gave me the impression they were looking into the issue, so I waited all day, hoping to hear back
- They never got back to me, causing me a great deal of anxiety
- My plans for the near future are what makes this really bad:
  - I am planning to use my websites, hosted via forethought.net, to help me find work
  - I am planning to use sites online to help me find work
- If I was promoting these sites or working for someone online or both, this would be unacceptable, and reflect very poorly on me!
- It is becoming increasingly clear that, in light of these plans, **forethought.net is not a viable long term option**
- I was a loyal customer of forethought.net for 10-20 years - and at this point the emphasis is clearly on the **was**

### Thu. 2018-05-10:

- No word from forethought.net to indicate they are even working on this
- Getting increasingly frustrated, and fairly early, when feeling quite grumpy, expressed this in a not-very-nice text message to forethought.net
- Not super-proud of the not-very-nice text message sent yesterday, but assumptions die hard and realizations can be painful
- That evening, after facing some hard realizations and cooling down a bit, took a closer look at the screenshots they sent
  - Got the idea to look at the settings on the Netgear modem I bought from Microcenter, which "mostly worked" for many years
  - Thought that maybe between those and the screenshots I could figure out how to configure the new modem
  - While looking at these settings and experimenting a bit (to utterly no avail), I noticed the Netgear modem got me connected
- After a bit of fiddling around with things, managed to get my entire LAN online using the Netgear modem I bought from Microcenter, woot!
- Started to upload the 200M video I shot at Google I/O Extended, because I was anxious to share it

### Fri. 2018-05-11:

- Have not heard one single peep from forethought.net
- It's way clear by now that they do not give a shit
- Still online using the old modem - "just barely" - it is slow and a bit flakey, going up and down
- Tried to upload the 200M video I shot at Google I/O Extended, but it failed after running all night and into the next day
- This is clearly pathetic and totally unacceptable, it's like they *want* me to dump them for another provider

### Sat. 2018-05-12:

- Still not a peep from forethought.net
- Started this log of issues
