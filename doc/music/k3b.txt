When ripping, k3b frequently hangs when the downloaded tags contain a lot of special characters.

If it hangs, or better yet before it hangs:

- Edit Info: remove all special characters from the album-level tags
- For each track: hightlight then F2 or enter to reduce the name to alphabetical chars only
