# How to Make a Landing Page

Still having major writer's block on this last and most essential step.

And I need at least three, and maybe as many as five of these!

Hopefully having a process will help.

# References:

The best URL:

* https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-launch-an-effective-landing-page-for-your-project-f15bf3433d16#

The best book:

* *To Sell Is Human,* by Daniel H. Pink: http://www.danpink.com/books/to-sell-is-human/

And still I have the writer's block!

# Process

Start with the first three sites:

[ ] tomwhartung.com

[ ] joomoowebsites.com

[ ] groja.com

Do these later - or sooner if inspiration hits (in the form of overflow from the others, etc.).

- [ ] (??) seeourminds.com (??)

- [ ] (??) tomhartung.com (??)

## Step (0) Review the References

For the "ideal layout," see "the best URL."
Adapt it as necessary to my content.

It's ok to leave each site's headers and navigation as-is.

## Step (1) Identify the CTA

For now, the call to Action on all sites is:

* The Contact Me page on tomwhartung.com

## Step (2) Gather the Essentials

2.1 Identify an image or video

- [ ] tomwhartung.com
  - **Make a short video!?!**

- [x] joomoowebsites.com
  -   My portrait from the meetup

- [x] groja.com
  -   My Spiritual Portrait (Tom H. 1987)

2.2 Identify the services

Answer the questions:

* What am I selling?
* Why should customers contact me?

briefly but thoroughly.
These answers feed into the pitches.

[ ] joomoowebsites.com
    "Device Detection in LAMP CMSes is our specialty"

[ ] groja.com

2.3 Write the pitches

Follow the how-tos in the Pitch chapter of *To Sell Is Human.*

[ ] 3-6 pitches for each service
    Pixar pitch
    Twitter pitch
    One-word pitch

Pick the ones that best fit the service being sold.

## Step (3) Identify supporting pages

In a few cases, it may be best to write some supporting pages and articles before creating the landing page.

3.1 Contact Me page on tomwhartung.com

Re-do the Contact Me page on tomwhartung.com:

* Social media icons and links
* Google form
* Phone number
* P.O. Box

3.2 About page on tomwhartung.com

Re-do the About page on tomwhartung.com:

Make it a story - but not too long!

* Why I am switching to consulting
* How I made the four lists
* Why it is difficult for me (not a sales guy - mention the book!)
* Why it is necessary (specialized services, changing tech, etc.)
* Why I have low expectations starting out
* Hopes for going forward

End on a hopeful note, e.g., "It's All Good!"

## Step (4) Profit!

Still hoping to see some of this soon!
