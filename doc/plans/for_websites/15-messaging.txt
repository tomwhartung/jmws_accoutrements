 Messaging
===========
This work is inspired by some Digital Marketing Workshops (meetups)
I have been going to, put on by Dan Stratford of Stratex Digital Marketing.

See documents in ~/marketing/advice/Stratex/ , especially
Stratex-5-Messaging-Platform.docx .
Of particular interest, when we get to segments, could be the first two
of those documents, that concern personas.

Message Types
-------------
(1) Engagement Message
- What issue will get their attention?
- What problem of theirs can you solve?

(2) Solution Message
- What are the criteria that must be met to best address the persona's problem?

(3) Reinforcement Message
- Describe your solution and how and why it is the best option for addressing
  the solution criteria
- Highlight the key points of differentiation (as it relates to the nearest
  competitive alternatives)

(4) Value Message
- As a result of implementing your offering, how will their life be better than before?
- What metrics can the customer use to prove the value of your offering?
