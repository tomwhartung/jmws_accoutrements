 Installing Groja VM on Jane
=============================
Prerequisite: Thumb drive with copy of VM built on bette.

References:
-----------
See ../2017-groja1-bette/0-vm_install.txt
Because we have already created the VM, this process is considerably easier.

On Linux System, Before Installing a New VM:
--------------------------------------------
[ ] Set up bridged networking
[ ] Install KVM and dependencies
    See doc/ubuntu/specific_hosts/2016-bette/3-experimenting_with_extras.txt

Unpack tar file and use it to create a new VM
---------------------------------------------
***
*** THIS DID NOT WORK
*** WHEN I TRIED TO ACCESS THE VM, IT SAID IT COULD NOT FIND THE FILE /usr/local/tar/zzz-unpack_vm
*** THIS IS OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE WE DELETED IT
*** KEEPING THESE STEPS FOR FUTURE REFERENCE
*** SEE BELOW FOR DETAILS ON OUR NEXT ATTEMPT
***
[ ] Find a file system with at least 22G of disk, needed to unpack the tar file (!!!)
    As root:
      mkdir /usr/local/tar/zzz-unpack_vm
      cd /usr/local/tar/zzz-unpack_vm
      cp /media/tomh/FATTHUMB4-1/var_lib_libvirt-groja1.tgz .
      tar -xvzf var_lib_libvirt-groja1.tgz
      chown -R tomh libvirt
    Must run chown to avoid permissions issues later
    Warning: this takes up a lot (22G) of disk!
[ ] Run KVM Virtual Machine Manager and create a new VM
    Use icon locked to launcher or use Search your computer icon to start the
      KVM Virtual Machine Manager
    File -> New VM: New VM dialog
      Import existing disk image -> Forward
      Provide the existing storage path:
        Browse (local) to: /usr/local/tar/zzz-unpack_vm/images
        Select file: groja1.qcow2 -> Forward
      Choose Memory and CPU settings (accept defaults)
        Memory (RAM): 1024 MiB
        CPUs: 1 (Up to 2 available) -> Forward
      Create a new virtual machine
        Name: groja1 -> Finish
    ***
    *** Did not specify an operating system (if there are issues we may want to try again)
    *** Did not expand Network selection widget dropdown (if there are issues we may want to try again)
    ***
[ ] Cleanup
    As root:
      cd /usr/local/tar/zzz-unpack_vm
      rm -fr *
      cd ..
      rmdir zzz-unpack_vm

***
*** Trying the process again, this time:
*** -> Create new filesystem for working with VMs
*** -> Mount this new filesystem on /var/lib/libvirt
*** -> Copy only the images/groja1.qcow2 file into the new partition (e.g., into a from_bette directory)
***

Create new filesystem for working with VMS
------------------------------------------
[ ] Insert the Ubuntu installation disk and boot into Ubuntu 16.04 (may take awhile)
    Select Try Ubuntu (may take awhile)
[ ] Use the "Disks" application to create a new 50G partition for VMs
    Use the Ubuntu home icon to find the "Disks" app and open it
    Select the last (spare) partition
    Delete it
    Select the new unused space and create a 50G partition
    -> When I did this, all my partitions disappeared!
    -> Omfg I thought I would have a holy heart attack!
    -> Turns out they were still there, this app must have a bug!
[ ] Reboot (removing the installation CD)
[ ] Update /etc/fstab to:
    - mount the new partition (sda13) on /var/lib/libvirt
    - mount the new spare partition (sda14) on /mnt/spare/sda14
    As root:
      blkid /dev/sda13
      blkid /dev/sda14
      cd /etc
      vi fstab
[ ] Mount the new partition on /var/lib/libvirt-new
    As root:
      cd /var/lib
      mkdir libvirt-new
      mount /dev/sda13 libvirt-new
[ ] Copy the current libvirt/* files to the new partition
    As root:
      cd /var/lib
      cp -rp libvirt/* libvirt-new
      mv libvirt libvirt-current ; mkdir libvirt

Use the groja1.qcow2 file from the thumb drive to create a new VM
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Copy the groja1.qcow2 file from the thumb drive to the new partition
    As root:
      cd /var/lib
      mkdir libvirt/from_bette
      cd libvirt/from_bette
      cp /media/tomh/ext4Thumb/var_lib/libvirt/images/groja1.qcow2 .
      cd ..
      chown -R tomh .
    Must run chown to avoid permissions issues in create VM dialog
[ ] Run KVM Virtual Machine Manager and create a new VM
    Use icon locked to launcher (or use Search your computer icon) to start the
      KVM Virtual Machine Manager
    File -> New Virtual Machine -> New VM dialog
      Import existing disk image
      -> Forward
      Provide the existing storage path:
        Browse -> Browse local to: /var/lib/libvirt/from_bette
        Select file: groja1.qcow2
      Choose an operating system type and version
        OS type (dropdown) -> Linux
        Version (dropdown) -> Ubuntu 14.04
        -> Forward
      Choose Memory and CPU settings (accept defaults)
        Memory (RAM): 1024 MiB
        CPUs: 1 (Up to 2 available)
        -> Forward
      Create a new virtual machine
        Name: groja1
        ***
        *** Tried this and it broke networking, falling back to using the default values
        *** Expand Network selection widget
        ***    Select -> "Host device enp2s0f0 macvtap"
        ***    Source mode: Bridge
        ***
        *** It is saying: "In most configurations, macvtap does not work for host to guest network communication"
        *** So this might be the wrong choice
        ***
        Keep default values for networking (do NOT expand the Network selection widget)
        -> Finish
