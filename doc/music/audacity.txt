 Using Audacity to Rip Vinyl to Mp3s
=====================================
The process is simple enough, but can be a little tricky when we haven't done it in awhile.

Click Removal
- I have done this in the past but we do not always want this
- We can call minor clicks "quaint!"
- References for when they are "bad" and we want to remove them:

Quick keys:
-----------
Ctl-A - Select all
Ctl-1 - Zoom in
Ctl-2 - Zoom normal
Ctl-3 - Zoom out
Ctl-E - Zoom to selection
Ctl-B - Give a track name to the current selction

Adjusting the Input Level:
--------------------------
1. Start with System Settings -> Sound
   Ensure it is set to Unamplified
2. Play the album and adjust the microphone's input level
   For the Bob Marley albums I am doing, around 0.45-0.50 looks good
3. Ensure there is no clipping
   Look for Red lines in the meter toolbar -- these indicate the recording has been clipped at some point
   See reference for location of meter toolbar and the relevance of the Red lines

Recording Process
-----------------
1. File -> Save As into directory:
   /art/music/analog_projects/Audacity/<Artist>/YYYY[_MM_DD]-<Album>
   Add the Month and Day when an artist has multiple releases in a single year
2. Record
   Do not pause when flipping, use that dead space for noise reduction
3. Optional: Noise Reduction:
   Click and drag to select dead space between sides
   Effect -> Noise Reduction -> Get Noise Profile
   Ctl-A (select all)
   Ctl-E (zoom to selection)
   Effect -> Noise Reduction - remove noise
4. Optional: Find Silence
   Ctl-A (select all)
   Analyze -> Silence Finder
5. Split into Tracks
   Option 1: Use tracks found in step 4,
   Option 2: Select a range of the audio for a track and use Ctl-B to name it
6. File -> Edit Metadata
7. File -> Export Multiple Tracks
   Export into:
     /art/music/mp3-new/<Artist>/YYYY-<Album>
   Check the metadata for each track
8. Tar and copy to a linux host, e.g., bette
     tar -cvzf YYYY-<Album>.tgz YYYY-<Album>
     toBette YYYY-<Album>.tgz
9  Fix file names (remove spaces and special characters) by running:
     fixMusicFileNames
10. Use Easytag to add album artwork and check mp3 ID data

Tips
----
ALWAYS clean the record first - it can't hurt!

Splitting into tracks:
o Silence finder doesn't work very well on live recordings
o It's much easier to use Ctl-B to add track labels
