 Getting Comfortable
=====================
Install the basic stuff we need to get around and do the other stuff.

This is the process we are running to set up the vm groja1.
-----------------------------------------------------------
The goal is to:

1. Downgrade to php5 and
2. Get the joomla 1.x version of groja.com/seeourminds.com working

Server Necessities for Comfortableness
--------------------------------------
[ ] Install any new updates
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
[ ] Install rcs, vim, subversion, openssh-server, git, git-svn, (??git-stuff, git-magic??)
    -> Note: many packages already installed
       See ./0-windows_install.txt, under Questions and Answers -> Packages to install
    sudo apt-get install rcs vim subversion
    sudo apt-get install openssh-server
    sudo apt-get install git git-svn
[ ] Setup static IP

    As root:
      cd /etc/network
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l interfaces
      vi interfaces
      -> Update as indicated in References above
      address 192.168.122.50
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 10.0.0.1
      dns-nameservers 192.168.30.2 192.168.31.2
    NOTE:
      Restarting the network service (/etc/init.d/networking stop|start|restart) had no effect!
      Had to reboot for it to work!

[ ] Home Directory - should be minimal for servers
    Copy selected files and directories from home directory on another host
      .bashrc, .bash_aliases*, .gitconfig, .vimrc, backup, bin, r*

[ ] Set up root account: .bashrc, links to .bash_aliases*
    Must mount thumb drives manually in the server distro
    As root:
      cd /mnt
      mkdir usb
      mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
    Copy files to ~tomh and ~root as appropriate
    As root:
      ln -s ~tomh/.bash_aliases .
      ln -s ~tomh/.bash_aliases-ava  .
      ln -s ~tomh/bin  .
      ln -s ~tomh/.vimrc   .
      vi .bashrc    ## Add cusTOMizations
      which ci
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l .bashrc

[ ] Update /etc/hosts and verify ssh is working
    Installing openssh-server seems to be enough to get it going
    Combine public keys from other hosts into authorized_keys
    As tomh:
      ssh-keygen
      cd ~/.ssh
      cat pubs/* >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
      Push over a copy of /etc/hosts
    As root:
      cd /etc
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l hosts fstab
      cat hosts
      more ~tomh/tmp/hosts
      mv ~tomh/tmp/hosts .
      vi hosts
      ci -l hosts
    Test using ssh to get from host to host.

[ ] To support automounting of usb thumb drives

      https://usbmount.alioth.debian.org/
    As tomh:
      sudo apt-get -y install usbmount
