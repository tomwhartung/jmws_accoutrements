 Team Building With Groja.com
==============================

Part 0: Introduction
--------------------
This is the first in a series of articles about:

- My theory about why psychological diversity is important
- Some ideas about how I would like to use the Groja (c) program test this theory

(I have been thinking about these ideas for a long time now.)

I am working on these articles in parallel, but will publish them sequentially.
