The release includes a booklet made of four sheets of paper stapled together in the middle that fits snugly inside the case. The front duplicates the cover of the CD and the back features a photograph of the venue.

The booklet features many photographs, both in color and black-and-white, of the band playing on stage and of the crowd in attendance at the show.  The left side of the last two pages feature a photograph of Jerry Garcia on stage, and the remaining page-and-a-half pages list the venue, band members, tracks on the three CDs, and production credits and copyright information for the release.<ref>Booklet included with Dick's Picks Volume 34, &copy; 1977, 2011.</ref>
