 Updating Python Etc.
======================
We are playing around with some python on bette, and want to have
our process down for when it comes time to upgrade the installations
on jane, barbara, and ava.

Running these commands on ava
-----------------------------
NOTE:
We need version 0.12 of flask for the test_insert_functions function
in db_access.py to work.
So we need to upgrade these packages on barbara and ava when deploying!

NOTE:
We need to be very cognizant of what versions of python, flask, and django we are
running on the servers!

NOTE:
We may want to consider using virtual environments on the servers at some point.
However, I would like to avoid doing that, in the interest of keeping it simple,
which means keeping installed software and versions to the bare minimum.

Upgrade Python
--------------
[ ] Upgrade python 3.5 to 3.6

      http://www.ubuntumaniac.com/2016/12/python-360-is-released-install-on.html
    As root:
      add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
      apt-get update
      apt-get install python3.6

Upgrade Flask
-------------
[ ] Upgrade flask to version 0.12
    (This is a little trick I learned in the real python class.)
    As root:
      pip3 uninstall flask
      pip3 install flask==0.12
NOTE:
  This was already the current version on ava (!)

Install sendmail for groja.com
------------------------------
We need sendmail on all servers so we can use python to send emails:
Note that this fixes the following error:
    ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused
[ ] Install sendmail
    As root:
      apt-get update
      apt-get upgrade -y
      apt-get -y install sendmail
