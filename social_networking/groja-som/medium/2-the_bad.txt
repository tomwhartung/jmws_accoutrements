The Bad:
--------
I want to help people - myself included - see past the surface.

This is an image of Tony Soprano's personality.  To learn more about how this image represents his personality, see his spiritual portrait at SeeOurMinds.com.

One Bad thing is, not everyone will get this.  Understanding these images requires a little bit of "work."

Another Bad thing is, the personality assessment used does not cover everything.  For example, morality, intelligence, artistic, and athletic ability, none of these show up in these spiritual portraits.  People expecting to see these qualities represented in the images will be disappointed.

And yet another Bad thing is, it takes a long time to create these images.  Creating a single image of Charles Foster Kane recently took most of a three-day weekend.

People expecting to instantly understand my spiritual portraits will be disappointed.  People expecting to see all of the latest fictional personalities on the site will be disappointed.

Working Every Day
-----------------
I work every day to create and publish more examples, and will continue this work as long as time permits.

And it's a lot of work!  Watching a single season of Game of Thrones and then drawing a few portraits from it can take up to a week.

Some people will pick up on the patterns - the correlation between the colors and their attitudes - more quickly than others.  Some people will close themselves off to it completely right from the start.

And that's to be expected.  Part of our innate individuality is that we are all in a different position relative to Kandinsky's Triangle.

Bottom Line:
------------
"Lotta poor man make a five dollar bill, keeps him happy all the time.
Some other fella's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cryin'."

It may be best to just assume many people will understand and appreciate this work only after I am dead.  The bottom line is, if you get it, great, but if you don't, I don't and can't really care, because I'm very busy!

Getting off on Tangents:
------------------------
Of course, a lot of this time is spent on research - which is enlightening, entertaining, and enjoyable -
but that doesn't mean I can churn these out in a few hours each.
(If you skip the commentaries and watch each episode only once or twice, you are missing out.)
(Also, incubation is a very important part of my process.)
I run this site out of my home, and so clearly have marketable skills, but so far I have made zero money from this passion project.
This does not count the years I have spent writing multiple versions of the program, and the years spent
going to a shit ton of meetups trying to figure out the best way to present and hopefully ultimately monetize this idea.
This goal is far from complete, but I feel I'm on the right track, and far more importantly, know where I can get help.
If you'd like to help me keep the site up to date by contributing to my efforts, <a ...>Contact Me!</a>
It has taken me decades to create this site.
