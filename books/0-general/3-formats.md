References found concerning the various file formats available for publishing ebooks.

## The Main Concern

### Initial Impressions

Putting "thumbnail" images in tables works fine in odt, docx, and pdf files.

These tables look like crap in .epub, .mobi, and azw3 formats - which people
commonly use for ebooks.

## Exporting and Converting

### Exporting

- Exporting a pdf from Libre Office works ok
- Exporting an epub from libre office does not work at this time
  - Tried all options

### Converting

- Use calibre to convert
  - Add odt or docx file
  - Convert option opens a dialog box

The dialog box contains a lot of options and they are somewhat dependent on the
output file type.

- Converting with calibre works much better than exporting from libre office
- There are still issues with the images, though
  - Tables of images do not look right
  - The images are not centered on pages with just one image

I did not try all the options, though - and there are a lot of them.
