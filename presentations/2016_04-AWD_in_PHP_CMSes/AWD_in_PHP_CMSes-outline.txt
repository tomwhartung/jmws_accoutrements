======================================================================
What I did on my code-cation: 10 Slides in 10 minutes.

 Outline: List of Slides
-------------------------
1. Who - Introduction
   1.1 Elevator Speech & Favorite Quotes
       1.1.1 First job, Masters Degree, most marketable skills: Java & PHP
       1.1.2 A bit of a polyglot - interested in pretty much everything
       1.1.3 "... not the best, but the only one ..."
       1.1.4 "Specialization is for insects"
       1.1.5 "Will specialize for food"
   1.2 Shot of Github account - current streak
2. What - Overview
   2.1 Added Device Detection
       List Device Detectors
   2.2 To (resume and) three popular CMSes
       List the CMSes with some relevant details
   2.3 Adaptive Web Design (AWD), more accurately RESS
3. Why - The Five Whys, and More
   3.1 Why?
   3.1.1 Increase web presence
   3.1.1.1 Don't think well on my feet during interviews, so "get my story straight"
   3.1.1.2 Don't want to waste time in interviews when it is not a match - answer "the usual questions" in advance
   3.1.2 Heard in a previous HTML5 meetup that having a personal site that looks different...
   3.1.3 Have something to present at meetups
   3.1.4 Think this knowledge may be useful as the Internet of Things gains traction
   3.1.5 Fun fun fun to be the first (and learn why no one else has bothered)
4. When - Took About a Year (including resume)
   4.1 Pie Chart(s) - 1 or 2 slides???
   4.1.1 Time by CMS: 25% Joomla, 25% Wordpress, 10% Drupal 7, 40% Drupal 8
   4.1.2 Time by Activity: 40% Learning, 20% Coding, 20% Experimenting,
         20% Maintenance (updates, deployment, content, etc)
   -->   Need to think about this
   4.2 One pie chart per slide?  Additional pie charts desired/relevant?
   4.2.1 
5. Results - Just the Facts
   5.1 JooMooWebSites.com - the Joomla site
   5.1.1 Three views of home page, using the override
   5.2 TomWHartung.com - the WordPress site
   5.2.1 Three views of home page, using the override

6. Conclusions - Lessons Learned and Resultant Opinions
   6.1 Lessons Learned
   6.1.1 Learned I am more of a back-end person
   6.1.2 Learned why more people are not doing this: it is difficult and not guaranteed to work
   6.1.3 Learned new sources for information about new software (youtube and twitter)
   6.1.4 Learned that this is fairly easy with a single page document, but not so much with a CMS
   6.1.5 Learned why Drupal people specialize on it (it's complicated)
   6.2 Opinions
   6.2.1 Still convinced that sending the same content to all devices is not optimal
   6.2.2 I am sorry to have spent so much time with Drupal but glad I finally satisfied my curiosity about it
   6.2.3 ...............
   6.2.4 My curiosity about Drupal has now been replaced by curiosity about Python CMSes, django, tornado, etc.
   6.2.5 Not sure how, but I do believe what I have learned will come in handy as I forge into the Internet of Things.
         (which brings us back to one of the Five Whys)
