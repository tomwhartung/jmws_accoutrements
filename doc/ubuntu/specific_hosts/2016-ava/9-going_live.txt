================================
Note to self: be discreet about details shared with the world here on github.
Just sayin'!

[ ] Review Django Deployment Checklists
    For a few of these that we have found along the way, see
    ../2016-jane-1/4-setup_wsgi_for_hosting_python.txt

[ ] Update tera-wurfl
    Review and update docs (README files, etc.)
    Update code
    Update db

[ ] Clean obsolete code out of all LAMP sites' directories
    [ ] ava - make it ultra-clean
    [ ] jane - ok to leave some stuff (e.g., drupal7 code)

[ ] Ensure all LAMP sites are running the latest version
