 Goals
=======
It really helps to be clear about these, especially if I am going to be seeking advice from others.

Top Goals in Order of Importance
--------------------------------
1. Resilience
Long life, willing to do the work I love for most of it, even to the very end.

2. Money
We all need it, the more the better, at least up to a point.

3. Engagement
Want to keep up-to-date with changes and trends.

4. Self-actualization
