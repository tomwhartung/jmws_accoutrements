There are two types of developers: Experts and Polyglots.

Because it is impossible to know everything about a single thing, or a considerable amount about everything, this is naturally a continuum.

Experts are primarily motivated by ego and money.

Polyglots are primarily motivated by agnosticism and curiosity.

This dichotomy is the source of Impostor Syndrome.
