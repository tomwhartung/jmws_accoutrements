== Enclosure ==

The release includes an enclosure consisting of two sheets of paper stapled together in the middle.  Consisting of eight pages, including its front and back cover, it fits snugly inside the case.  The front duplicates the cover of the CD and the back features a color photograph of the [[prairie]] with a fence stretching out into the distance and a tornado forming in the sky above it.

The first two pages inside the enclosure feature a [[collage]] of memorabilia from the tour and the band's recent studio album [[Wake of the Flood]].  The middle two pages feature a [[photomontage]] of eight photos, three in color and five in black-and-white, of the band members performing on stage.  The [[penultimate]] page contains a single black-and-white photo of the band on stage in front of a color photo showing lightning bolts, and the last page lists the band's members, credits for the release, and the tracks on the three CDs.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 19, 2000.</ref>
