==Enclosure, article, and fan letter==
Included in this release is a single-sheet enclosure, folded into fourths accordion-style, yielding eight pages.  One side features two side-by-side pages with the disk's credits and copyright information underneath a wide photograph of the entire band on stage, followed by two more side-by-side pages with the track listing interspersed with smaller photographs focusing more on each of the band's members.

The other side features two pages containing a newspaper article and a letter to guitarist Jerry Garcia from a fan, with the fan letter partially covered up by a photo of the band.  A page that is mostly black follows this, and the last page reproduces the cover of the CD.  The CD's credits include a "Special Thanks to J. Corkey Custer/Emerald City Chronicle," which implies the newspaper clipping is from the [[Emerald City Chronicle]].

=== Article and fan letter ===

The article is entitled "There's nothing like a Grateful Dead show" and was written by Michael St. John.  It focuses on the February 3rd show at Madison, and in the first paragraph the author mentions that "Phil Lesh said that they would have to play in Madison more often."  He writes that the two drummers, Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, "play together, and off one another, as if they were one."  Michael goes on to state that "This reciprocal action and reaction is characteristic of how the Dead play in general", and that when they played newer songs off their recent studio release, [[Terrapin Station]], they substituted "intricate improvization" for "the orchestration" on the release.  St. John ends the article by stating "Madison hopes that you remember us on your next tour, Phil."

The fan letter is [[Manuscript|hand-written]], dated February 4, 1978, and signed by Paul, a 20-year-old guitarist who is "primarily a jazz fan of the Miles Davis school."  He writes of how he was impressed by both Jerry's "long improvisations" and his "shorter breaks in the first set", and claims that "you are one of the great stylists of guitar."  Paul goes on to state that "What really impressed [me] last night was seeing an established player like yourself who is still practicing and growing - it's really an inspiration to me as [a] guitarist to keep me progressing."  He closes by writing "Someday, if I get the opportunity, I'd like to meet you as you've been so important to me for so long from afar."<ref>Dick's Picks Volume 18 enclosure, 2000.</ref>
