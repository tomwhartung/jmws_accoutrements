 Business Objectives
=====================
As of 2017, the core reasons for working on these sites has changed:

o from demonstrating that I am capable of using this technology
o to actually making money directly from this work.

Thus, we pretty much need to rework them from scratch, and this is
where we start.

Business Objectives
-------------------
These are based on some of what I learned taking the Google Analytics
classes at analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com over the weekend.

Site                 Business Objective
------------------------------------------------------------------------
groja.com            Lead Generation - for personal spiritual portraits
seeourminds.com      Content - drive visits to groja.com and display AdWords ads
joomoowebsites.com   Branding or Lead Generation - device detection in LAMP CMSes
tomwhartung.com      Lead Generation - for freelance consulting
tomhartung.com       E-commerce - sell albums and display AdWords ads

Monetization
------------
How I can profit from each of these sites, without having to rely on recruiters
or friends to find me work.

Site                 Income Source
----------------------------------------------------------------

tomwhartung.com      Freelance consulting KISS: start with the basics

Mission Statements
------------------
I probably should have actually written these down before even buying the
domain names.  Better late than never, I guess!
