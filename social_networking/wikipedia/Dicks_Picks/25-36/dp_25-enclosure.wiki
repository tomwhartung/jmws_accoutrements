== Enclosure ==

The release includes an enclosure made of two sheets of paper stapled together in the middle. Consisting of eight pages, including its front and back cover, it fits snugly inside the case. The front duplicates the cover of the CD and the back is dark reddish-brown with a slight gradient.  This same dark reddish-brown gradient serves as the background for all of the pages inside the enclosure.

Inside the enclosure, the first two pages feature a [[collage]] of three images: a large black-and-white photograph of Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, a small photograph of some sound equipment, and a small, colorful drawing of a three-dimensional checkerboard motif with stars on top and musical notes at the bottom surrounding a red and blue heart with a white lightning bolt in the center.  The middle two pages contain a color photograph by Jim Anderson of the entire band on stage.

The [[penultimate]] page lists the locations and dates of the recordings, the band's members, and the tracks on the four CDs.  Finally, the last page contains a large black-and-white photo of the band on stage above the production credits for the release, the caveat emptor statement, and copyright information in fine print at the very bottom.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 25, 2002.</ref>
