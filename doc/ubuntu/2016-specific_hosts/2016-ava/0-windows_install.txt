============================
Download correct iso file, verify md5sum, and burn to CD

    Select C: drive
    Properties (Win 7) or Drive Tools (Win 10)
    Defragment Disk (Win 7) or Optimize Drives (Win 10)
[ ] Shrink Win 10 partition (saved from when we did barbara)
    Reference: http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2015/11/how-to-shrink-windows-10-to-make-space.html
    Start (Cortana) -> Disk Management (window appears
    Right-click on C: -> Shrink volume
    Accept defaults: 116G NTFS and 103G Unallocated

[ ] Turn off fast startup (Win 7)

[ ] Confirm that the system does not use UEFI
    Start icon -> type "System Information"
    Unable to find BIOS mode; googling was not fruitful
    Press F2 to get into BIOS (this does not look like other BIOS screens I have seen)
    I am not seeing any settings - specifically the UEFI Secure Boot option -
    mentioned in the Reference, so did not make any changes.

 Install:
----------
[ ] Boot options: check disk for defects - why not?
[ ] Configuring install as usual, then get this about message UEFI
    - Installer started in UEFI mode
    - Continuing may make it difficult to reboot into "any BIOS-mode OSes later."
    - Asking whether I want to force UEFI mode?
    - Forcing may make it difficult to boot into windows later
    -> "Force UEFI installation"
       Selecting "No"
[ ] Fresh disk partitions:
    229.4G available
    -  Modeled after actual use on lauren and allowing for growth
    -  Allowing for installing a new OS at some point
    -  Allowing spares
    Partitions specific to a version of the OS
      2 X 24G /       (/mnt/future/)
      2 X  1G /boot   (/mnt/future-boot/)
      2 X  5G /home   (/mnt/future-home/)
      2 X 30G = 60G Total
    Partitions that can be shared with other versions of the OS
      1 X 21G /var/www
      1 X  1G /usr/local/bin
      1 X  8G swap
      1 X 30G = 30G Total
    Partitions for file systems that can cause trouble (by filling up, etc.)
      These should NOT be shared, but we are creating only one of each
      -> See how it goes with these, and if they prove useful,
         create new ones when installing the next "future" OS.
      1 X  5G /usr/src
      1 X  5G /lib/modules
      1 X  5G /var/cache
      1 X  5G /var/log
      1 X 20G = 20G Total
    Grand total:
      60G + 30G + 20G = 110G
    Left Over:
      229.4G - 110G = 119.4G
      1 X 20.0G /mnt/spare/sda?
      1 X 99.4G /usr/local/tar - Use remainder of disk
[ ] Installing: Questions and Answers
    Automatic updates?
    -> Install security updates automatically
    Packages to install?
    -> LAMP server
    -> standard system utilities (already checked)
    -> Virtual Machine host (!!)
    -> OpenSSH server
    Windows detected, grub installed, but dual boot not working
[ ] Fix dual boot:
    Reference:
      http://askubuntu.com/questions/142750/after-installing-ubuntu-from-usb-grub2-cant-be-installed/142751#142751
    As tomh:
      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair
    Running it gave an error, but after rebooting, Windows 7 showed up as an option, and it works.
