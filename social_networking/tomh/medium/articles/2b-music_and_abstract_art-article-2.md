# Music, Meaning, and Modern Art: Part 2 of 3

This is part two of a three part series of articles written for people who love music but do not understand abstract art.

[Part one]() is about Bob Dylan's song All Along the Watchtower and [part three]() is about the Talking Heads' first four albums.

All three articles use highly-acclaimed works that have stood the test of time to help explain how musicians and painters use
abstractions to add value and meaning to their work.
Spoiler alert: the secret is, when the meaning is not obvious, listeners and viewers need only to learn how to add their own
meaning to the art they hear and see.

Sound complicated? It isn’t! All it takes is a little imagination.

## Exercising Your Imagination

Look at Kandinsky’s woodcut of Two Birds (1907) above and:

1. Imagine you are listening to Blackbird by The Beatles - or listen to [this version by Paul McCartney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swUlDc3v3DE)
2. Rather than being about a bird, imagine the song is about African Americans
3. Rather than representing birds that fly, imagine the birds in the woodcut represent two people, or groups of people, one black and one white

Easy enough, right? Ok, now we’re ready!

## Jazz Can Be More Abstract

Jazz, especially when it's instrumental and doesn't have lyrics, can be much more abstract than most folk, rock, and folk-rock.

Take, for example, some of the music by John Coltrane.

#### John Coltrane - Alabama

John Coltrane - "Trane" - wrote the song
[Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_(John_Coltrane_song))
in 1963.

Image: images/Ray_Charles_and_John_Coltrane.jpg

Although he wrote it in response to the
[bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Street_Baptist_Church_bombing),
in
[Birmingham, Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama),
today there is no way to tell that from the song itself.
Indeed, today it is difficult to even imagine
[people doing such a thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-MuWDsv5pg).

This act of white supremist terrorism killed four girls and injured twenty-two others.

At the time, everyone knew this was Trane's motivation for writing the song.
[Listening to it now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saN1BwlxJxA), however,
you might think its theme is similar to that of the song
[Georgia on My Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glggureA_Kk)
by Ray Charles.
Nothing could be further from the truth!

- Compare to Blackbird by The Beatles

#### John Coltrane - A Love Supreme

The passion Coltrane felt for the
[African-American civil rights movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1954%E2%80%931968))
surfaces fully a couple of years later, in his magnum opus,
[A Love Supreme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Love_Supreme).

Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1274626

The album is very spiritual and contains four songs or "parts:" 1. Acknowledgement, 2. Resolution, 3. Pursuance, and 4. Psalm.
You can listen to
[the whole thing on youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll3CMgiUPuU).

Others have written about this masterpiece much more elegantly than I ever could.
One
[article at nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/23/arts/music-coltrane-at-75-the-man-and-the-myths.html)
reviews it in the context of Trane's life and other works, and
[another at wbur.org](http://www.wbur.org/artery/2014/10/10/coltrane-love-supreme-50)
describes why it is still relevant after fifty years.

In my mind, Miles Davis provides the best perspective on Trane's magnum opus.

#### Miles Davis - On Trane, A Love Supreme, and Civil Rights

I first learned the significance of what John Coltrane was saying in A Love Supreme when I read about it in Miles Davis' autobiography.

[Here is the whole thing, from pp. 285-286 of his Autobiography, written with Quincy Troupe and published in 1989.]

```
Trane's music and what he was playing during the last two or three years [1965-1967]
of his life represented, for many blacks, the fire and passion and rage and anger and rebellion and love that they felt,
especially among the young black intellectuals and revolutionaries of that time.
He was expressing through music what H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael and the Black Panthers and Huey Newton
were saying with their words, what the Last Poets and Amiri Baraka were saying in poetry.
He was their torchbearer in jazz, now ahead of me.
He played what they felt inside and were expressing through riots - "burn baby burn" - that
were taking place everywhere in this country during the 1960s.
It was all about revolution for a lot of young black people -
Afro haircuts, dashikis, black power, fists raised in the air.
Coltrane was their symbol, their pride - their beautiful, black, revolutionary pride.
I had been it a few years back, now he was it, and that was cool with me.
```
[Separate paragraph.]
```
It was this way for many intellectual and revolutionary whites and Asians as well.
Even his change to a more spiritual music in the music on A Love Supreme - which was like a prayer - reached
out and influenced those people who were into peace, hippies and people like that.
```
[Using only the above, but here is the rest of that paragraph, for possible future reference.]
```
I heard he played a lot of love-ins, which was becoming the rage all over California for a lot of whites.
So he was reaching different groups of people, too.
His music was embraced by a lot of different kinds of people, and that was beautiful and I was proud of him,
even if I liked his earlier music more.
He once told me that even he liked some of the music he did earlier better than what he was doing now.
But Trane was on a search, and his course kept taking him farther and farther out; he couldn't turn back even though I think he wanted to.
```
[Separate paragraph - unused - too sad!]
```
His death created chaos in the "free thing" because he was its leader.
He was like Bird to all those musicians who considered themselves "out" - you, know, "free," out in space:
he was like a god to them.
When he died it was much like when Bird died for a lot of bebop musicans who looked to him for directions,
even though he himself had been directionless for a lot of years.
Ornette Coleman was still around, and some turned to him.
But for most Trane had been their guiding light, and after he was gone they seemed to me like people in a
boat in the ocean without compass or paddles.
It seemed a lot of what he stood for musically died with him.
Even though some of his disciples carried on his message, they carried it to smaller and smaller audiences.
```

After reading this, I bought Trane’s album right away!

#### BYOM: Filling in Coltrane's Blanks

To really understand this music requires a knowledge of some American History.
The web and your local library give you access to a lot of this information, totally for free.

I recommend watching at least one of these civil rights documentaries from the mid-1960s:

- [History of the Civil Rights Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxwe6LPvkM) (5:52)
- [Alabama City Remembered as Climactic Battle of Civil Rights Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggUt0gJh9U8) (4:27)
- [Burmingham 1983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0lD37bq8YI) (4:22)

And at least part of at least one of these speeches by
[Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.)
from that period:

- [I Have a Dream - August 28, 1963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UV1fs8lAbg) (17:28)
- [Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Speech - December 19, 1964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r98tT0j1a0) (12:01)
- [Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence - April 4, 1967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qf6x9_MLD0) (53:46)

The more you learn about race relations in America during the early-to-mid-1960s, the more you will be able to appreciate John Coltrane’s music.

Outline for conclusion:
1. Compare and contrast cover of Robert Frank's book The Americans with Martha Graham's dance Heretic
-  For both: give background, context, and links to more information
-  Which one is more beautiful?
-  Which one is more informative?
-  Which one is more abstract?
-  Which one is more meaningful?
-  Which one is more accessible?
-  Which one do you prefer?
2. "Both of these are extremely powerful works of art that kind of say the same thing:"
- Treating people unfairly because they look a little different and hence belong to a minority is hurtful
3. These show disequilibrium, I find Mondrian's paintings to be much more positive (e.g., show a mostly black-and-white painting)

#### BYOM: Filling in Mondrian's Blanks

What if I told you that the opposites in Piet Mondrian's paintings can represent any pair of opposites, whatsoever?

Image: images/Piet_Mondrian-1939-1942-Composition_10.jpg
Title and Attribution: Composition No. 10 - By Piet Mondrian, 1939-1942. Public Domain.
Link: https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=37643395

Take his Composition 10, for example.
Because this painting is so abstract and pure, the meaning of its elements is completely open to interpretation.

So, for example, the white areas could represent white people and the black areas could represent black people - or vice versa.
Or, the white areas could represent women and the black areas could represent men - or vice versa.
Or, the white areas could represent older people and the black areas could represent younger people - or vice versa.

Similarly, for example, the vertical lines could represent white people and the horizontal lines could represent
black people - or vice versa - and the white could just be the background.
Or, the vertical lines could represent women and the horizontal lines could represent men - or vice versa - and
the white could just be the background.
Or, the vertical lines could represent older people and the horizontal lines could represent younger people - or vice versa - and
the white could just be the background.

Or, the vertical lines could represent ______ and the horizontal lines could represent ______, and
the little colored boxes could represent ___ and ___ and ___!
Fill in the blanks as you see fit - human life is full of pairs of opposites!

And now you know the true nature of the power lying in Mondrian's Pure Neo-Plastic art!

#### I Want to Believe

The important thing to realize is that, no matter what identity we assign to the opposites in this painting,
each pair opposites - black vs. white, horizontal vs. vertical, etc. - is in non-symmetrical equilibrium.
I want to believe this means that eventually things will work out, and people will be able to live in equilibrium.

The song
[War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPZydAotVOY)
by
[Bob Marley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley)
confirms that this is how things will turn out - or else.

```
Until the philosophy which hold one race superior
And another, inferior,
Is finally, and permanently,
Discredited, and abandoned,
Everywhere is war
Me say war.
```

Plus, I have eyes, I can see what's going on - and

## Conclusion

Image: images/Wassily_Kandinsky-1914-Fugue.jpg
Title and Attribution: Fugue - By Wassily Kandinsky, 1914.
Link: http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/work-101.php

Certainly the fact that Kandinsky's Fugue represents a type of music
may have something to do with it selling in 1990 for $20,900,000.

Links to additional information about the image in the introduction, for possible use in the conclusion.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue
https://curiator.com/art/wassily-kandinsky/fuga-fugue
http://www.myswitzerland.com/nl-nl/fuga-fugue.html

The truly beautiful thing about abstract art is it can take on meanings that were not foreseen by the artist when they created the work.
For example, Pablo Picasso painted Guernica long before Bob Dylan wrote All Along the Watchtower.

-------------------------------

### In Conclusion

To be honest, when I first learned this I was a bit pissed off!
Of course, punk rock was huge at the time so everyone listening to that was a bit pissed off about something!

In this case, I was a bit pissed off that I hadn't learned this sooner.
- It all makes such total sense, in some ways it's like, "duh."
- Too bad teachers think it's more important to teach us about wars and the like.

But sometimes it's nice to have things spelled out in black and white.
Hopefully this helps you better appreciate abstract art!

# Copied From the Beginning

[Not sure whether we want to use this first-person stuff.]

When I first learned about abstract art, I was ready for it, because by then I had spent years listening to the
rich variety of music available in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.
The purpose of this article is to share with you the awakening I experienced in this regard in the art classes
I took at Virginia Commonwealth University [VCU](https://www.vcu.edu) in the mid-1980s.

If you have difficulty understanding how this painting, [Fugue](https://curiator.com/art/wassily-kandinsky/fuga-fugue),
created by Wassily Kandinsky in 1914 could
[sell at Sotheby's in 1990 for $20.9 million](http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/work-101.php), or
if you think Piet Mondrian's paintings are "just a bunch of squares," this article is for you!
