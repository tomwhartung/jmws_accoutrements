 Upgrading Drupal 8.0.0!
=========================
Old Reference: https://www.drupal.org/node/1223018
New Reference: ????

Development Host:
-----------------
Ran these commands to upgrade from 8.0.0-rc04 to 8.0.0:
	# Unpacked tar file for 8.0.0 into drupal-8.0.0-04-try_adding_dot_git_dir/
	gothh
	git clone git@github.com:tomwhartung/tomhartung.com-d8.git
	l
	cd drupal-8.0.0-04-try_adding_dot_git_dir/
	ls -al
	cp -rp ../tomhartung.com-d8/.git .   # cloned just like a second ago
	ls -al
	gs
	cp -rp ../tomhartung.com-d8/.gitignore  .
	cp -rp ../tomhartung.com-d8/README.md   .
	gs | grep deleted
	ga --all
	gc 'Upgraded to the new official release, 8.0.0.' ; gpom
	gs

This seems to have worked!  Knock on wood!
Beware the gitignored/sites/default/files dir!
*** And note we would lose the .gitignore (which would be very very bad) and
*** README.md files if we did not copy them before committing!

Backup and Production Hosts:
----------------------------
[ ] jane - this is a new process, make sure it works!
[ ] lauren - only when the others are done and all bugs are worked out

(Old d7) Overview of Process on backup and production hosts:
o  Pull the new code into the directory that is already being served
   (so we do not have to run any of the ln* scripts)
o  Restore already-updated db from bette to this host

New d8: TBD
