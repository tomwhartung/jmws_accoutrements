# 6-https

It's time to get https going on seeourminds.com , and maybe others.

## Options

Note that there are two options:

1) Let's Encrypt
2) Self-Signed

## Goals

We definitely want to use the Let's Encrypt option on barbara and ava.

We would prefer to use the Let's Encrypt option on jane, but
if that is a hassle or not feasible for some reason,
we may want to go with Self-Signed, or maybe even just http.
