I want to help people see past the surface.
Many people like to see only the surface, not past it, and some will undoubtedly feel offended by my desire to see past it.
Moreover, I believe that some people feel the need to insult others and their work to
subconsciously compensate for some perceived lack in themself, e.g., their inability to see past the surface, and
perhaps even their failure to think about seeing past it before finding one of my spiritual portraits online.

Ultimately, one way or the other, it's a new spin on an age-old trope: one perceived insult leads to a counter attack,
soon both parties spiral into a bottomless pit of complete negativity.
As an idealist, I try my best to refrain from that sort of senseless behavior, and
 it's a complete waste of my time to try to educate a complete stranger who has no desire to learn.
In other words, some people have no desire to acknowledge the existence of Kandinsky's triangle,
 much less participate in the movement of it toward it's ultimate destination.
Yes people like this do exist.  They have smart phones but no interest in being smart, being only interested in putting themselves above others in any way they can.

Only addressing this negativity and hostility once.  Not wasting time on closed-minded dumbasses.
