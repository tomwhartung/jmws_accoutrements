Sites with reviews of hosting providers recommended for python-based sites.

Ideally, one with a free tier would be nice, especially for the sites on the back burner right now.

# Part 1: Lists and Reviews

Interestingly, at first blush there seems to be very little overlap.

1. Includes the providers I have been thinking about
  - https://djangostars.com/blog/top-django-compatible-hosting-services/
2. Start with free hosting, then scale up as necessary - sounds good!
  - https://marginhound.com/free-python-hosting-a-guide-to-finding-it-using-it-for-small-projects-and-scaling-up/
3. Mentions google cloud -- initially my top choice, having seen their presentation -- at the end:
  - https://geekflare.com/python-hosting-platform/
4. Following the initial list is a longer section diving into each one -- presumably, at least
  - https://hostingtribunal.com/best/django-hosting/
5. Includes Digital Ocean and some others
   - https://www.hostscore.net/choose/best-python-hosting/
6. In-depth and mostly positive review of pythonanywhere.com
   - https://www.thoughtlytics.com/blog/in-depth-review-pythonanywhere-for-python-website-hosting
7. Displayed at the top of the list of search results
   - These include a section on "Why You Donâ€™t Want Free Python Hosting"
     - Note the extremely SEO-enhancing domain name, hostingadvice.com
     - I **suspect** these guys are into affiliate marketing and so free hosting earns them $0.00 in commision!
     - So take their recommendations with a grain of capitalistic salt
   - https://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/best-python-hosting/
   - https://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/best-django-hosting/

There may be more of these listicles, but that's a good start.

# Part 2: Providers

These are providers I definitely want to look at.

- Python Anywhere
  - Mentioned in multiple lists in Part 1
  - https://www.pythonanywhere.com
- Google Cloud - has a free tier
  - https://cloud.google.com/python/
  - https://cloud.google.com/python/getting-started/
- Digital Ocean - no python-specific pages came up in my initial search
  - https://www.digitalocean.com/
  - I feel like I owe them because they have posted so many useful articles about Linux sys admin topics!
- AWS - Amazon Web Services
  - https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/deploy-python-application/
- Azure - Microsoft Cloud Hosting
  - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/python/

Currently brainstorming and sanity-checking my options, and not looking very closely at any of these quite yet.
