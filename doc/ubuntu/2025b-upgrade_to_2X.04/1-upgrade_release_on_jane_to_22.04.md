Jane has a lot of stuff on there (e.g., my sites and React, etc.), so we don't want to do a fresh install


# Upgrade Jane

- Upgrading to 22.04 should be straightforward and safe
- Consider upgrading to 24.04
  - Note that we can hold off on doing this for a year or two


# Preparations

- [X] Update `tarHome` to backup most relevant files for adding to new install
- [X] Run `tarHome` on jane to be sure we have the latest
- [ ] Review the procedure here:
