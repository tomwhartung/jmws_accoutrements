Overview of Initial Series of Articles for Medium
-------------------------------------------------

Why:
I am convinced it will be best to address nay-sayers up front from the start.

This way, if someone posts a negative or hostile comment to one of my posts on social media, I can just post url to one of these articles.

The idea is to (try to) minimize the time spent worrying about stupid yet arrogant assholes who are full of
the negative, destructive, condescending, ignorant bullshit that all too frequently pervades these public sites.

This in turn should allow me to focus more time on moving Kandinsky's triangle further upward.

Prerequisite:
Write an article for the Tom H. medium account about Kandinsky's book, Concerning the Spiritual in Art.
The article should focus on his triangle and how my life-long dream is to aid in moving it further upward.

How:
Write a series of three *short* articles that preemptively address the negativity I am sure to run into.

Titles:
(1) The Good ...
(2) The Bad ...
(3) And the Ugly

Overall Format:
1. I have done this __________
2. The Good/Bad/Ugly thing is ____________
3. Result: I will be keeping on keeping on.
