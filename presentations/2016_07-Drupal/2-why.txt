 Why Would Someone Do Such a Thing?
====================================

Really, just mainly out of curiosity.

Noticed that very few people were doing this - integrating Device Detection with LAMP CMSes - so it seemed like an opportunity to do something unique.

A side goal: intuitively it seems to me that knowing about LAMP CMSes would be a good start to getting possible freelance work.

Another side goal: CMS selection for Groja/SeeOurMinds.com

Ultimately though, just mainly out of curiosity.
