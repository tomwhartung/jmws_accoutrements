 Discussion Questions
======================
Thinking there are no simple and easy answers here, and I may find that people disagree.

DQ.1. Trend to Self-Employment
------------------------------
Why do I see so many people on Facebook who are Self-Employed?
What are these people doing?
Why have I not gotten into this?
  (Probably because I have virtually no business savvy and have been able to get by finding jobs by staying flexible.)
It seems to me that most if not all artists are forced to do this from the start.
   So I should be able to do my GROJA idea, right?
--> Discuss.

DQ.2. Type of Business and Team Size
------------------------------------
Going to startupy meetups, I find many encourage building a team.
Freelancing:
   Obviously a team of one - or NOT?
Device Detection:
   Start as one, grow as necessary?
Wanting a Bank Loan:
   Is some sort of team necessary, or does this depend on the idea?
--> Discuss.
