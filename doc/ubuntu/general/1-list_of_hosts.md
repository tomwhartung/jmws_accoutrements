# My Hosts and Their Purposes

Sometimes we need to look at the big picture, and stay focused on the long-term goals.
I have mostly Ubuntu hosts but there are a few others.

## Ubuntu Hosts

jane - main dev host
barbara - backup
ava - new production host

lauren - upgrade OS and use for social networking, maybe more
bette - upgrade OS and use for email, maybe more

## Other Hosts

humphrey - Intel Edison (Yocto)
rita - Mac Mini
veronica - Raspberry Pi (debian)

## List of Hosts That Need Updates

- [ ] lauren - Ubuntu 14.04 desktop - upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 when we get ava into production
- [ ] bette - Ubuntu 14.04 desktop - upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 when we get ava is done & grojas working in a VM
