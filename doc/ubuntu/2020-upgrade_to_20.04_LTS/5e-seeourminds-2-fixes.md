- [ ] CSS Issue

## CSS Issue

Hopefully upgrading to MDB5 will resolve this issue.

The content of the `blockquote` tags look just like that of the `p` tags.
Something is not right here.

Example: Nixon's page:

- http://127.0.0.1:8001/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5062/

## Subscribe Form on Home Page

Filling in a name and email in the subscribe form on the home page opens the groja.com conversion page, but it has errors.

## Check the Icons

Copy the icon list from groja.com to ensure the social media icons link to correct accounts.

## Review Home Page

Remove the free spiritual portrait offer, if it is present.

Some of the cards near the bottom need to be updated to the new situation.

## Quiz: Remove Save on Server Option

Not really interested in saving these.  Just display the results and leave it at that.  That's how the others work.

## Test the Quiz

**I made several very minor updates to class Score in `models.py`, so we need to re-test the quiz to make sure it still works.**
