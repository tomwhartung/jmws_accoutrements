Concerning Kandinsky's Concerning the Spiritual in Art
------------------------------------------------------
Discuss the book briefly, describing why reading it sometimes gives me inspiration.

Reference the triangle and its movement ever upwards.

Do NOT mention groja.com or seeourminds.com, except MAYBE briefly and in passing.

In general, focus on the Part I of the book, and focus on the triangle specifically.

Perhaps briefly describe Part II of the book, and hint that there may be a follow-up article about it at some point.

Quote the best parts from the book in the article.
