## Part 4: Conclusions

### 4.1. Basis

These images are based on Seasons 1-7 of the show.

### 4.2. Future Editions

After watching season 8, I may publish another edition including that

If I write an updated edition, people who purchase this edition may upgrade for free.

### 4.3. Tell Your Friends

I would rather watch more shows, read more books, and create new images than publicize this book.

The more popular this first edition is, the more likely it is I will create future editions.

So if you enjoy this ebook, tell your friends.

### 4.4. A Book Edition?

If the tv version is popular, I may sit down and read the books, and do another one including characters from the books.

If you would like to see this, drop me a line and let me know!

So tell your friends!
