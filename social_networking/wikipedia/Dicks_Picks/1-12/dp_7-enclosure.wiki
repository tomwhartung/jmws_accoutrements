==Enclosure==
Included with the release is a single sheet folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure about the size of the CD case. The front of this enclosure duplicates the cover of the CD and the back contains a drawing of a dragon eating its tail against a background of clouds that merge with the clouds on the cover.

The two pages inside contain a wide black-and-white drawing of the venue by [[Alfred Meeson]]. Above this drawing, in the clouds, is a list of the band's members above credits to those who created the CD, followed by a listing of the tracks along with copyright information on the far right side.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 7, 1997.</ref>
