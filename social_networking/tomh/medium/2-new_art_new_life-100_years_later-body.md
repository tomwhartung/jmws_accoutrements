# My Point

I like Mondrian's idealism and want to contribute to the awareness of the need for more
equlibrium and desire for equivalent relationships.

Or something like that.

# Body

In 1911, the Dutch painter [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) (1876-1944) moved from The Netherlands to Paris.
He soon began contributing to the
[De Stijl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl) - Dutch for "The Style" - art movement.

Mondrian started out painting representational, "particular" paintings of such things as trees and landscapes.
His paintings gradually became more and more abstract until all representation was "annihilated."

Reduced to only the essential elements, his later work consisted of images
containing black perpendicular lines and rectangles painted in primary colors on a white background.
He called this type of painting "Pure Neo-Plasticism" and the goal of his paintings was to
compose these essential elements so that these opposites of color and form would exist in equilibrium.

It looks easy to create these compositions, but it is not!

I have learned through experience that changing one of his paintings - his Composition With Red, Blue, and Yellow,
for example - even slightly destroys the image’s equilibrium.
For proof, see the gallery of experimental “Mondrianesque Compositions” at seeourminds.com.

The evolution in his paintings is interesting, but his writings - which explain his
perceptions and reasons for painting like this, are fascinating.

## The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships

Mondrian completed his final book
[The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Art-Life-Collected-Twentieth-Century/dp/0306805081)
in 1931, but by then had been working on it since at least 1921.
That may not quite be 100 years ago, but it's close enough.

In this book he claims that just as art has evolved into a composition containing opposites of form and color in equilibrium,
so will future society.
Following is a quote from the book's Introduction, written by Mondrian in 1932:

> The culture of art demonstrates that only *man's development* in the distant future can create universal equilibrium through the *establishment of equivalent relationships.* These relationships are already realized in pure art - art free from figuration and all limiting form - expressing the beauty of equivalent relationships exclusively through pure line and color.  This art is an image of the ideal human goal toward which humanity is moving.

Are we here today any closer to the goal of living in universal equilibrium than Mondrian was 100 years ago?
Join me in taking a look at some more quotes from this book and see if we can answer that question!

## The New Art - The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships (1931)

Written over a period of three years, based on ideas developed over the previous decade, but never published during his lifetime.

*Emphasis in original.*

> If art is an expression of life and anticipates it, we can state that the new life is *the culture of equivalent relationships.*
> Just as with the plastic means in art, it is evident that for this life our mentality must become more ore less purified,
> not in an old-fashioned puritanical way, but so as to rise above the oppression of limiting, particular forms.
> Thus in the same way as art, life reaches a state of real equilibrium
> *through pure and equivalent relationships of increasingly free individuals.*
(p. 248)

I see parallels between what he is saying in the next quote, about subject and particular form,
in the (supposed) trend to ignoring demographics (race, gender, age, etc.) in hiring.
In reality, progress in this area has been made, but there is still a ways to go.

> Today we see subject and particular form, once of such great importance in the work,
> rejected not only as being a primitive means of expression, but also as limiting expression.
> Until now their use has been prolongd by tradition and necessity - equally by convention and inertia.
(p. 249)

In this evolution of art and life it is sincerity, rather than conformity, that matters:
> In life every sincere effort leads to human evolution, and it is the same in art.
> Rightly seen, there remains *a single path of evolution* that, regardless of time, *is identical for life and for art.*
(p. 249)

> However, even in the new aesthetic, the word equilibrium has caused many misunderstandings and repeated errors.
> The only way to correct them will be by attentive study of the plastic expression of the new art.
> It will be seen that the equilibrium in the new art is not a static state without action, as is generally thought but,
> on the contrary, *a continuous and mutually annihilating opposition of equivalent but unequal elements.*
(p. 252)

> *The physical aspect of man, of life, diminishes in opposition to the spiritual aspect, which becomes stronger.*
(p. 254)

> It is therefore of great importance for humanity that art manifest in an exact way the constant but varying
> rhythm of opposition of the two principal aspects of all life.
> The rhythm of the straight line in rectangular opposition indicates
> *the need for equivalence* of these two aspects in life: *the equal value of the material and spiritual,
> the masculine and feminine, the collective and individual, etc.*
> Just as the vertical line differes in character from the horizontal, so in life the two aspects have their inherent and opposed character.
> But just as in art these lines have different dimensions, so individuals and their groups differ in strength or size.
> *Art demonstrates that life, through equivalence of its opposed aspects - despite tehir different nature - can approach real equilibrium.*
(p. 254)

> Art demonstrates that the true realization of real life requires *individual liberty.*
> The new life will attain this liberty materially and spiritually.
> Although joined to others by mutual equivalent relationships, the individual will be no less free,
> because of the equivalence of these relationships.
> The new art gives *independent existence* to line and color in that they are *neither oppressed nor deformed by particular form,* but
> establish their own limitations *appropriate to their nature.*
> Likewise, in future life society will allow each individual in *independent existence consistent with his own character.*
(p. 255)

> When we understand the equivalence of contrary oppositions of art's rhythm, we work more consciously to build truly human life.
> For least attention is given to establishing equilibrium through *equivalence of the two fundamental oppositions.*
(p. 256-257)

> Whether we conceive life as joy or as suffering depends on which is most important to us: abolition or creation.
> The beauty and the misery of concrete life consists precisely in the fact that we can escape neither abolition nor creation,
> thus neither joy nor suffering.
(p. 259)

> If evil is synonymous with abolition and thus with suffering, and
> good is synonymous with creation and thus with joy, then in real life good and evil destroy each other.
> But in concrete life good and evil oppose each other.
> And it is also a characteristic of life's beauty and misery that we can escape neither one.
(p. 260)

> Nothing is more unfortunate for life than the concealment of reality: truth.
> Since life is truth, life is then concealed.
(p. 260)

> By enclosing ourselves within the small circle of what is agreeable to us, we unjustly separate ourselves from others,
> from universal life and all its beauties, which then remain concealed.
(p. 261)

The actions of creation and abolition will become increasingly united,
so that more and more we will be able to create by abolishing.
Gradually the long periods of abolition and of creation will diminish;
gradually peace and war will become one and annihilate each other.
As we appropach *equivalence of the two contrary aspects within us and outside us,*
we will gradually be less "lived by" life and become more capable of "living."
(p. 261)

The perfecting of science is one of the principal ways by which human progress leads to a more equilibrated state.
(p. 262)

The machine can free man from his state of slavery.  This cannot happen in a single day.
But in time the machine can restore man to himself.  For man *does not live in order to work; he works in order to "live."*
(p. 262)

> *[C]oncrete life is our actual human life, and it is logical that we are constrained to givit first attention.*
(p. 263)

If life and art demostrate that evolution takes place through the action of creation and abolition,
then all the miseries and all the advantages brought by the progresss of civilization *are so many necessities for man's evolution.*
But we generally see only one or the other of these two actions: thus life is seen either as declining or as unchanging.
Creation alone would mean no change, and abolition alone would mean ruin.
But those who see both actions as reciprocal understand life as *eternal growth.*
(p. 264)

> If all men were just and honest, all would be well and universal equilibrium would be spontaneously established.
(p. 265)

In life as in art, we must reckon with reality.  Not all men are just.
That is why those who are just must try *to elevate the true and the just in man,
must strive to create situations favorable to this development, and must attempt to
establish a mutual organization that prevents disequilibrium and constrains man to be just in his social relationships.*
(p. 265)

There will be nothing despotic in this constraint.
And in a probably distant future, order will be imposed only by *mutual necessity.*
(p. 265)

The day will come when the individual will be capable of governing himself.  The new art demonstrates all this.
(p. 265)

General concentration upon proper and mutual relationships is the way to solve all the problems of society.
(p. 266)

Because of corrupt conditions, man is often pressed, if not forced, to be exclusively preoccupied with money.
Money, that invaluable means of cifilization, should be only a "means of exchange" and not
assume a *limiting form* that oppresses and debases other forms of life.
(p. 266)

> Capitalism as cultivated until now is a limiting form that is abolishing itself and
> will be abolished in the culture of equivalent relationships.
> ....
Although a more stable world equilibrium will follow, the new form will still be too dominated by money to allow it to
spread equivalently through the world.
For the future, Neo-Plastic demonstrates for every area *an organization of equivalent relationships and not a new form.*
(p. 266)

### Team and Relationship Building

**Key quote for using spiritual portraits for transparency and better relationships.**

Love and friendship play an important role in mutual nonequivalent exchange.
The new art demonstrates that in order to achieve real equivalence the oppositions of a relationship must be pure.
To become pure they must first be separated, that is, disengaged from whatever they are confounded with.
When the two aspects of life are confounded, hypocrisy controls and betrays us.
This is why it is enormously important for the new art to establish *purified forms and pure relationships:
they do not conceal, they are real and show themselves for what they are.*
(p. 267)

> A just solution must be found, for all human beings are basically equal and all are entitled to an equivalent existence.
> This is not achieved by charity or love or friendship, for these qualities cannot create pure relationships.
> *The essential value of each individual entitles him to an existence equivalent to that of others;*
> if disabled, he must be supported *in keeping with the value* that he is unable to realize; he is a communal responsibility.
> This is important not only for those who are incapable of contributing equivalent values,
> but also for the others who, being assured of a livelihood, will have the strength to cultivate themselves,
> to live their own lives, that is, to give u p their dependence upon limiting forms.
> The entire community would thus benefit.
(p. 267)

Why do we not outlaw all arms making and destroy all weapons now existing in our "civilized" society?
With weapons outlawed, it would be far less easy for men to kill each other.
But in our society so many make their fortunes or live by these barbaric instruments.
Again it is *particular interest* tjat sustains war.
(p. 268)

In politics it is not enough to work toward internally equivalent relationships, we must above all
achieve equifalent relationships of international order.
In art, Neo-Plastic demonstrates this necessity most exactly.
Through intersecting lines, the mutual relationships destroy each plane's separateness so that all unite completely.
(p. 268)

> Just as art itself has slowly created a new plastic expression of more real equilibrium,
> life itself will slowly create this equilibrium in a new social and economic organization.
(p. 269)

> High universal morality finds its expression in the apogee of the culture of equivalent relationships.
> Art in its end demonstrates that only line and color free from all oppression of form can constitute equivalent relationships.
> Thus in life only the free individual and groups of free individuals can form a mutually equivalent organization and
> become capable of realizing the content of high universal morality, which prescibes that we live for each and for all.
(p. 270)

**This sums it up quite nicely:**

> Every day we are astonished by the complete absence of true love, friendship, brotherhood, kindness.
> Centuries and centuries ago the great mesage of universal love was proclaimed: although its influence is undeniable, man has not changed.
> Therefore, let us not insist upon what has shown itself as unrealizable.
> Art demonstrates that *life impels humanity toward equivalence of its two opposed aspects and
> thus toward the destruction of individual limitations.*
> This is how life can realize the high ideals proclaimed so long ago.
(p. 273)
