# My Hosts and Their Purposes

Sometimes we need to look at the big picture, and stay focused on the long-term goals.
I have mostly Ubuntu hosts but there are a few others.

## Ubuntu Hosts

Ubuntu is so easy to install and keep updated, and everyone knows what it is.

### Workflow Ubuntu Hosts

Currently using these hosts for creating, maintaining, and updating my sites.

* jane - main dev host
* barbara - backup
* ava - new production host

### Extra Ubuntu Hosts

I was using these for backup and production, until barbara and ava came along this year.

* lauren - upgrade OS and use for social networking, maybe more
* bette - upgrade OS and use for email, maybe more

## Other Hosts

Bought these pretty much out of curiosity, the satisfying of which gives me extreme pleasure.

* humphrey - Intel Edison (Yocto)
* rita - Mac Mini
* veronica - Raspberry Pi (debian)

## List of Hosts That Need Updates

- [ ] lauren - Ubuntu 14.04 desktop - upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 when we get ava into production
- [ ] bette - Ubuntu 14.04 desktop - upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 when we get ava is done & grojas working in a VM

## Who are These People?

I name all my hosts after Film Noir actors and (mostly) acresses.

* ava - Ava Gardner
* barbara - Barbara Stanwyck
* bette - Bette Davis
* humphrey - Humphrey Bogard
* jane - Jane Russell
* lauren - Lauren Bacall
* rita - Rita Hayworth
* veronica - Veronica Lake

The more you know!

### A Moment of Silence

Can we have a moment of silence for our deceased hosts?

* gloria (Gloria Grahame) - original development host
* marilyn (Marilyn Monroe) - original backup host
* ida (Ida Lupino) - original production host
* lizabeth (Lizabeth Scott) - $4000 Dell laptop that wasn't worth the price, so now I always buy cheap ones!
