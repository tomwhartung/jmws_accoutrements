 Updating Python Etc.
======================
We are playing around with some python on bette, and want to have
our process down for when it comes time to upgrade the installations
on jane, barbara, and ava.

Running these commands on jane.
--------------------------------
NOTE:
It appears we need version 0.12 of flask for the test_insert_functions function
in db_access.py to work.

NOTE:
We will want to upgrade these packages on barbara and ava when deploying!

NOTE:
We need to be very cognizant of what versions of python, flask, and django we are
running on the servers!

NOTE:
We may want to consider using virtual environments on the servers at some point.
However, I would like to avoid doing that, in the interest of keeping it simple.

Upgrade Python
--------------
[ ] Upgrade python 3.5 to 3.6

      http://www.ubuntumaniac.com/2016/12/python-360-is-released-install-on.html
    As root:
      add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
      apt-get update
      apt-get install python3.6

Upgrade Flask
-------------
[ ] Upgrade flask to version 0.12
    (This is a little trick I learned in the real python class.)
    As root:
      pip3 uninstall flask
      pip3 install flask==0.12

Install sendmail for groja.com
------------------------------
We need sendmail on all servers so we can use python to send emails:
Note that this fixes the following error:
    ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused
[ ] Install sendmail
    As root:
      apt-get update
      apt-get upgrade -y
      apt-get -y install sendmail
NOTE: Got the following warning when installing sendmail on jane
      (and all the others too, btw):
   "Warning: 3 database(s) sources
      were not found, (but were created)
      please investigate."
Tried googling this but did not see anything about how to fix it.
