Affiliate marketing changes a lot, and it would be great to have a way to
easily find and change the links we have in our content.

# Why We Need Flexibility

Here are some examples of why flexibility is important:

- Google has ended its program
- Barnes and Noble changed the company they were using, from Rakuten to CJ Affiliates, and didn't tell many people

## Motivations Specific to CJ Affiliate

- CJ Affiliate was originally Commission Junction
  - Companies merge and rebrand

### From the "CJ Affiliate Publisher Service Agreement"

The **CJ Affiliate Publisher Service Agreement** is at https://www.cj.com/legal/psa-us

> (e) Updating Links. If Links to Advertiser are not dynamically updated through the Network Service,
> upon notification You are obligated to update an Advertiser's Links in order to earn Payouts.

From section "6 Term, Termination, Deactivation and Notices" of the CJ Affiliate Publisher Service Agreement

> (c) Termination or Deactivation by CJ. CJ may terminate You, one of Your Web sites, or Your use of a promotional method, from an Advertiser's Program, at any time in CJ's sole discretion

and

> (d) Termination of Programs and Offers. Programs and Offers may be discontinued at any time.

Therefore we need to build flexibility into our use of their links.
