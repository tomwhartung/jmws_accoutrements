X. Theory of Encouraging Introverts to Speak Up
-----------------------------------------------
My Assumptions
--------------
a) In meetings and public forums, a few people tend to dominate the conversation
b) Close to half the population is Introverted(link to stats on mbti site)

Employee Morale
---------------
If people don't feel like they have a voice, they will be grumpy.
This sort of bad attitude can literally be contagious.
When people are afraid to speak up about negative things, it becomes impossible to solve the underlying problems.

Theory of Encouraging Introverts to Speak Up
--------------------------------------------
Encouraging Introverts to speak up can enable gaining insight into hidden problems and issues.

X. Theory of Self-Knowledge
---------------------------
Self-knowledge can lead to better relationships and higher resiliency:

Self-knowledge is:
- Knowing your preferences, your own strengths and weaknesses.
- Knowing what you like to do and can do well.

X. Theory that Sometimes No Relationship Is a Better Relationship
-----------------------------------------------------------------
I used to listen to people put me down without responding,
- believing people have free speech
- not wanting to respond with an insult of my own, and spiral downward into a pit of negativity
I used to smoke, and when someone would piss me off I would "let it go," go smoke, and feel better.
When I quit smoking, this was no longer possible.
Now I think it's best to just avoid toxic people, rather than argue with them or
try to fool myself that they are ok or even valuable "friends."

X. Theory of Direct Communication
---------------------------------
As opposed to passive aggressive communication.
