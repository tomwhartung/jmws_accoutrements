The Free Press Needs You!

To continue being free and able to print what they want -- which is kinda important in a democracy -- people need to do two things:

1. Consume a variety of opinions rather than rely on a single source
2. Be willing to accept that things are confusing
   - There is not necessarily an objectively right or wrong answer
   - There is not necessarily a right or wrong answer for you, personally
   - Remaining agnostic is perfectly acceptable.
   - You can always change your mind entirely, or decide when to decide - or even decide not to decide - later.
