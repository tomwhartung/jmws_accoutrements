If I want to add affiliate marketing links on my sites and cover my butt, I need to have a disclosure.

## Requirements

- The Affiliate Marketing Disclosure must be general yet specific enough to use on any of my sites.

## Strategy

From https://termsfeed.com/blog/affiliate-disclosure/ :

> You can always create a simple disclosure like the cartoon example from the NomNomPaleo website above that’s easy to place on individual web pages and blog posts, then have it link to a full page disclosure page to provide more information to your users.

Sounds like the foundation of a good strategy to me!

- Write full disclosure, included with the other legal documents under a "Legal" menu item
- Write a short, simple disclosure, to be included at the top of every page that has an affiliate link
  - This short, simple disclosure links to the full disclosure on a separate page
- Have a short, simple superscript string, such as "[$$]" or "[$!?]" , that immediately follows each affiliate link
- Program the superscript string so that
  - I can easily change the characters used if I want to
  - It takes the user to the part of the page with the short, simple disclosure
  - The text of the short, simple disclosure displays when the user hovers the mouse over the short, simple superscript string
