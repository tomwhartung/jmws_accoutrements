> Earlier this year, the writer and artist Jenny Odell began to look into
> an Amazon reseller that had bought goods from other Amazon resellers and
> resold them, again on Amazon, at higher prices. Odell discovered an
> elaborate network of fake price-gouging and copyright-stealing businesses
> connected to the cultlike Evangelical church whose followers resurrected
> Newsweek in 2013 as a zombie search-engine-optimized spam farm. She
> visited a strange bookstore operated by the resellers in San Francisco
> and found a stunted concrete reproduction of the dazzlingly phony
> storefronts sheâ€™d encountered on Amazon, arranged haphazardly with
> best-selling books, plastic tchotchkes, and beauty products apparently
> bought from wholesalers.
