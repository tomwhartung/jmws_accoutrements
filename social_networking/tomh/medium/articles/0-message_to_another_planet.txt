 Greetings From Planet INxx
============================
Sometimes I feel like I'm on the wrong planet.

This article explains why.

An understanding of these types helps me understand and more easily tolerate people who are different from me.
This is valuable because my type is under-represented.

Why Sometimes "Better Relationships" Means "No Relationship"
------------------------------------------------------------
It is estimated that INFPs comprise about 4.4% of the general population.
As an INFP, I am different.
Some people pick up on this right away.
This means when people insult me, I tend to let it go, because I know I'm sensitive,
and don't want people to feel like they are "walking on eggshells" when they are with me.
This means that sometimes people will push me over the edge.
As I get older, I am learning how to spot the warning signs.
I was brought up in a household where much communication was done in a passive-aggressive manner.
As I get older, I am learning how to be more direct.
As an INFP, I am open to stuff.
As an ESTJ, Tony Soprano doesn't take any shit from anyone.
Although it's difficult for me to put myself in his shoes, I absolutely respect that!
Some people pick up on this right away.
This means some people will try to take advantage of me.
As an idealistic but otherwise balanced person, I am capable of flipping into an
  ESTJ/Tony Soprano mode when someone pushes me too far.
When this happens, it can get UG-LY.
If you've ever seen that scene in the Sopranos where Tony and Ralph Ciffaretto
  have their last conversation, I will say my response is similar to that of Tony's, but less bloody.
If you've never see that scene, check out this song:
  Song: Peter Tosh - Stepping Razor
Summary:
I know I'm different, I know I'm sensitive, I try to be tolerant of others,
  but if you do not respect me, you need to stay away from me or you will get hurt.

I'm weird and I know it:
------------------------
Most people don't know what it's like to have a personality that's in the minority.
Such is the nature of minorities.

This is not to say I want some sort of special rights or anything.
Just want to say "hi" from my world.
