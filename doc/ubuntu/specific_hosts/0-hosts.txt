 My Hosts and Their Purposes
=============================
My main dev host jane is acting up, making the '/' filesystem read-only,
segfaulting on "df" commands and the like.

This means that barbara, which was destined to be the new production host,
is now taking over that role, at least temporarily.

It also means that we will be buying a new computer for the production
host role, probably this weekend.

List of Hosts and the Purpose of Each
-------------------------------------
ava (new) - Ubuntu 16.04 - production host
barbara - Ubuntu 16.04 - test, staging, and backup development and production
jane - Ubuntu 16.04 - run memcheck, fsck, and take in to get fixed
bette - Ubuntu 14.04 - upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 when we get ava into production
lauren - Ubuntu 14.04 - upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 when we get ava into production
