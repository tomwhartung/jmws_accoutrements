## [Cold intro - no heading]

This article is for people who love music but do not understand abstract art.

Using popular songs as examples, this article explains how musicians and painters use abstractions to add value and meaning to their work.
Spoiler alert: the secret is, when the meaning is not obvious, listeners and viewers need only to
learn how to add their own meaning to the art they hear and see.

When I first learned about abstract art, I was ready for it, because by then I had spent years listening to the
rich variety of music available in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.
The purpose of this article is to share with you the awakening I experienced in this regard in the art classes
I took at Virginia Commonwealth University [VCU](https://www.vcu.edu) in the mid-1980s.

If you have difficulty understanding how this painting, [Fugue](https://curiator.com/art/wassily-kandinsky/fuga-fugue),
created by Wassily Kandinsky in 1914 could
[sell at Sotheby's in 1990 for $20.9 million](http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/work-101.php), or
if you think Piet Mondrian's paintings are "just a bunch of squares," this article is for you!

## All Along the Watchtower

The song [All Along the Watchtower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower)
written by [Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan) but
covered most famously by [Jimi Hendrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY),
is a great example of a song with lyrics that are a bit vague.

Surely all music lovers love this song!

Based on the number of versions there are, it’s obvious that many musicians do!
In addition to
[Bob’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jd3iytj9SDQ), and
Jimi’s versions - [in the studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY] and
[at Woodstock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvVz88IHK4o),
there are versions by
[Dave Matthews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOaMQ-R9YGM),
[Neil Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DBewzgXgYk),
[Eddie Vedder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHBSvpzI7Tw),
[John Mayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJlkkRub6MU),
[Pearl Jam and Neil Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePvmDGlE8XA),
[U2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx2re_YBki0),
[Eric Clapton and Lenny Kravitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fMvW_FtALU),
[Dave Mason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n3f8NeUm-k),
[Bruce Springsteen, Clarence Clemmons and Neil Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCVjDFR5xtg),
and even
[Bryan Ferry])https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqg4V4BmJj0)!

[Link for lyrics: https://bobdylan.com/songs/all-along-watchtower/]

```
“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief
“There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth”
```

For one thing, there’s the music. There are only three chords so it’s easy to learn and jam to.
That certainly contributes to its appeal to musicians.

Blues songs also have only three chords, but this is no easy-going blues song.
The driving progression of the chords give those who hear a feeling of impending doom.

And although they are a bit vague, the lyrics confirm that the shit is about to hit the fan!

```
“No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke
“There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late”
```

Ostensibly a conversation between a joker and a thief, the first two verses remain confusing, even after decades of consideration.
The only thing certain here is that the time stealing and kidding around is over.

Surely the next verse will reveal a specific threat!

```
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl
```

BOOM.  No more stealing, no more jokes.  No more joker, no more thief.
And if anything, the vague threat is even more vague now.  Surely it is something far worse than a couple of riders.
Oh-kay.

The scene is a bit more complete, but precisely when this is happening remains unclear.
Also, how are all these people going to fit in a typical
[watchtower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchtower).

How can a story so vague - so abstract, and even contradictory - also be so widely recognized as one of the greatest songs of all time?

#### It's DIY Art!

If you can love this song - which requires a bit of filling in the blanks - then you can love modern art.
Because whether you realize it or not, when you listen to this song, you are supplying details from - and
feeling emotions felt only in - your own life.

A big part of understanding modern art is realizing you have to do it yourself (DIY).

Painters like Kandinsky and Mondrian - and there are many - did not set out to create works like
[Rembrandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt) or
[Claude Monet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet).
Those works are beautiful, but they are specific, full of what Mondrian called "particular forms."

Those incredibly beautiful works are, nevertheless, "just" the ballads of paintings.
[Me and My Uncle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAF0-EFCuG8)?
Nice, sure, but I'll take a 30-minute-plus long version of
[Dark Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyBs48VjMho)
any day!

We can all love All Along the Watchtower - because of rather than despite its vagueness - because
we have all been in a situation in which doom is impending!

Now, what if I told you that Picasso painted the aftermath of this apocalypse, decades before Bob Dylan wrote the song?

#### Picasso Painted the Aftermath!?

What happened after the impending doom came and the shit hit the fan for the people in Dylan's song?
The song doesn't yield any clue whatsoever.

When I try to envision the aftermath of the coming of the doom described in All Along the Watchtower, I see the painting
[Guernica](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/coleccion/obra/guernica)
by
[Pablo Picasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso).

It’s similarly structured: a jumble of recognizable forms that make it obvious that the shit has hit the fan!
No more jokers, thieves, princes, women, barefoot servants, or riders.
Even the horses those riders were on are done for!

There are easily several howling figures in this painting.
They may not be wildcats, but the feeling is undeniably the same.

Your vision of the aftermath of All Along the Watchtower might be the same, vaguely similar or it might be different.
Chances are, you never gave it a moment's thought till now.

Now you know how to see the beauty that modern art gives us.
It turns out it was hiding inside you all this time!

#### You Might...

You might think this is some heavy shit, or you might be all like,
[so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqNTltOGh5c)?
[You might find yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGofoH9RDEA) ... oh, never mind.
Whatever you might think, please keep reading, we're just getting started!

## Jazz Can Be More Abstract

Jazz, especially when it's instrumental and doesn't have lyrics, can be much more abstract than most folk, rock, and folk-rock.

Take, for example, some of the music by John Coltrane.

#### John Coltrane - Alabama

John Coltrane - "Trane" - wrote the song
[Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_(John_Coltrane_song))
in 1963.

Image: images/Ray_Charles_and_John_Coltrane.jpg
Title and Attribution: Ray Charles and John Coltrane - were both born on September 23rd.
Link: http://www.kzfr.org/broadcasts/322

Although he wrote it in response to the
[bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Street_Baptist_Church_bombing),
in
[Birmingham, Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama),
today there is no way to tell that from the song itself.
Indeed, today it is difficult to even imagine
[people doing such a thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-MuWDsv5pg).

This act of white supremist terrorism killed four little girls.
At the time, everyone knew this was Trane's motivation for writing the song.

[Listening to it now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saN1BwlxJxA), fifty years later,
one might be fooled into thinking its theme is similar to
[Georgia on My Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glggureA_Kk)
by Ray Charles.
Nothing could be further from the truth!

#### John Coltrane - A Love Supreme

Trane's passion fully surfaces a couple of years later, in his magnum opus,

#### Miles Davis - On Trane, A Love Supreme, and Civil Rights

Quote From His Autobiography

I first clued in to the significance of what Trane was about when I read the following passage
in Miles Davis' autobiography.
He states it quite beautifully; I really have nothing to add to this.

Image:
Title and Attribution:

[Here is the whole thing, from pp. 285-286 of his Autobiography, written with Quincy Troupe and published in 1989.]

```
Trane's music and what he was playing during the last two or three years [1965-1967]
of his life represented, for many blacks, the fire and passion and rage and anger and rebellion and love that they felt,
especially among the young black intellectuals and revolutionaries of that time.
He was expressing through music what H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael and the Black Panthers and Huey Newton
were saying with their words, what the Last Poets and Amiri Baraka were saying in poetry.
He was their torchbearer in jazz, now ahead of me.
He played what they felt inside and were expressing through riots - "burn baby burn" - that
were taking place everywhere in this country during the 1960s.
It was all about revolution for a lot of young black people -
Afro haircuts, dashikis, black power, fists raised in the air.
Coltrane was their symbol, their pride - their beautiful, black, revoulutionary pride.
I had been it a few years back, now he was it, and that was cool with me.
```
[Separate paragraph.]
```
It was this way for many intellectual and revolutionary whites and Asians as well.
Even his change to a more spiritual music in the music on A Love Supreme - which was like a prayer - reached
out and influenced those people who were into peace, hippies and people like that.
I heard he played a lot of love-ins, which was becoming the rage all over California for a lot of whites.
So he was reaching different groupsl of people, too.
His music was embraced by a lot of different kinds of people, and that was beautiful and I was proud of him,
even if I liked his earlier music more.
He once told me that even he liked some of the music he did earlier better than what he was doing now.
But Trane was on a search, and his course kept taking him farther and farther out; he couldn't turn back even though I think he wanted to.
```
[Separate paragraph.]
```
His death created chaos in the "free thing" because he was its leader.
He was like Bird to all those musicians who considered themselves "out" - you, know, "free," out in space:
he was like a god to them.
When he died it was much like when Bird died for a lot of bebop musicans who looked to him for directions,
even though he himself had been directionless for a lot of years.
Ornette Coleman was still around, and some turned to him.
But for most Trane had been their guiding light, and after he was gone they seemed to me like people in a
boat in the ocean without compass or paddles.
It seemed a lot of what he stood for musically died with him.
Even though some of his disciples carried on his message, they carried it to smaller and smaller audiences.
```

To really understand this music requires a knowledge of American History.
The web and your local library give you access to a lot of this information, totally for free.

1. Listen to Alabama and A Love Supreme - right now!
2. Find one or more videos of Martin Luther King's speeches and marches and watch them
3. Listen to Alabama and A Love Supreme again, with these particular forms fresh in your memory

I wager you will never be the same!

## First Four Talking Heads Albums

They were students at RISD so were familiar with abstract art.

- All their songs are very painterly.
- Maybe mention a song from each.

Consider this homework.
I will not go into great detail here - there's too much and you should be able to
figure this out for yourself by now.

Favorite line: "You can't see it till it's finished!"

Having dabbled in several art forms and can attest that this song is sufficiently abstract that it applies to all of them.

In fact, if there's an art form or just a genre that hasn't appeared yet, I am confident the ideas in this song will still apply.

#### Fear of Music

- Abstractions - the lack of particular forms - is one of the things that makes this song so great!

This whole album is so different from their first album, it's truly amazing to hear the progression!

This proves to me that understanding the abstract - freeing yourself from limiting particular forms -
is extremely powerful and hugely beneficial.

## Conclusion

Certainly the fact that Kandinsky's Fugue represents a type of music
may have something to do with it selling in 1990 for $20,900,000.

Links to additional information about the image in the introduction, for possible use in the conclusion.

https://curiator.com/art/wassily-kandinsky/fuga-fugue
http://www.myswitzerland.com/nl-nl/fuga-fugue.html

The truly beautiful thing about abstract art is it can take on meanings that were not foreseen by the artist when they created the work.
For example, Pablo Picasso painted Guernica long before Bob Dylan wrote All Along the Watchtower.
