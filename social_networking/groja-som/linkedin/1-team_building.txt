Team Building
-------------
Everyone uses a computer.  Hence, the market for technical products is diverse.
Having a well-rounded, diverse team is essential to developing a product that appeals to a diverse set of customers.
Diversity that is based on demographics is superficial at best.
It seems to me that even the smallest team needs to have members that can cover all four functions to some extent
As evidence of this I offer my sites, seeourminds.com and groja.com .
I am aware that, on the surface, the idea that forms the basis of these sites is not very pragmatic, not very down-to-earth.
And I have extensive experience in facing the difficulties inherent in attempting to monetizing any sort of product based on abstractions.
(I am totally fine with this, and know where I can find more pragmatic people to help me with this, if this is something I decide to do.)
I would like to test this idea of building a psychologicall diverse team on a few small teams - for a very low price, perhaps even for free.
If you would be interested in participating in this pilot program, please contact me!
