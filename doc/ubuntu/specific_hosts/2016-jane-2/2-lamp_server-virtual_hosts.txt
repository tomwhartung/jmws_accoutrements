 Get LAMP Sites Running
========================
LAMP as in LAM-PHP.  We do Python separately.

Ensure Required LAMP Packages Are Installed
-------------------------------------------
Some of these LAMP packages may or may not yet be installed.
[ ] Install as necessary, and ensure the installed versions of these packages match on:
    [ ] ava
    [ ] barbara
    [ ] jane
    Commands (as root):
      dpkg-query -l 'package_name_or_regex'   ## if it's not found, it needs to be installed
      apt-get install -s package_name         ## Simulate installation
      apt-get install -y package_name         ## Do it without requesting confirmation
    Install apache2, apache2-utils, apache2-dev (needed for wsgi)
    Install libapache2-mod-php7.0
    Install php7.0, php7.0-gd, php7.0-mysql, php7.0-mcrypt
    Install mysql-server

Populate /var/www

      NOTE: this is now a python site and will not work until we get WSGI going
        For more information see: 4-setup_wsgi_for_hosting_python.txt
      As tomh:
        mkdir -p seeourminds.com/htdocs/

      Clear caches, create tar file of tomhartung.com/htdocs/ , copy to barbara, jane, and ava
      Browser:
        bette.tomhartung.com/admin -> Configuration -> Development -> Performance -> Clear all caches
      As tomh on bette:
        bu th 01-goes_with_tar_file
        cd /var/www

        copy it to jane and ava
      As tomh on barbara:
        cd /var/www
        tar -cvzf tomwhartung.com_htdocs-barbara-2016_10_25.tgz tomhartung.com/htdocs/
        bu tw 01-baseline

Disk Space Spotcheck
--------------------
[ ] Disk Space Spotcheck:
    /:        6.3G/23G (29%)
    /home:    1.1G/23G (5%)
    /var/www: 9.1G/19G (53%)
NOTE: if we need space in /var/www, we can delete files in:
    /var/www/zzz-tar_files-old

Configure Apache
----------------
[ ] Add and update config files in /etc/apache2/sites-available as appropriate
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l *.conf   ## "Installed version"
    For best results, copy conf files from another host and check in to RCS
    Fix ServerAlias specifications in apache2/sites-available/*.conf files
    As root:
      ci -l *.conf   ## "Copied from host xxxxx and updated for this host"
[ ] Enable mod_rewrite and php7.0, and start apache2 (as root):
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2
      ls -al mods-*/rewrite*
      ls -al mods-*/php7.0*
      ls -al mods-*/mpm*
    If not enabled (or disabled, as in the case of mpm_event),
      run one or more of these commands as appropriate:
    As root:
      a2enmod rewrite
      a2enmod php7.0
      a2dismod mpm_event
      a2enmod mpm_prefork
[ ] Check that we have not yet enabled any sites:
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2
      ls -al l sites*/*.conf
    Only the sites-available/000-default.conf file should be linked to
      the sites-enabled directory
[ ] Put our standard, behind-the-firewall version of index.html file in /var/www
    As tomh on bette:
      cd /var/www/
      toJane index.html
[ ] Restart apache and test in browser, to ensure we are good to go.
    As root:
      service apache2 stop
      service apache2 start
    Access in browser:
      http://localhost
    Should see our standard, behind-the-firewall version of index.html

Ensure Static Sites Work
------------------------
[ ] artsyvisions.com
    As root:
      a2ensite 010-artsyvisions.com.conf
      service apache2 stop
      service apache2 start
      l sites*/*.conf
    Should see the sites-available/010-artsyvisions.com.conf file linked to
      the sites-enabled directory
    Access in browser:
      http://jane.artsyvisions.com
[ ] groja.com
    As root:
      a2ensite 020-groja.com.conf
      service apache2 stop
      service apache2 start
      l sites*/*.conf
    Should see the sites-available/020-groja.com.conf file linked to
      the sites-enabled directory
    Access in browser:
      http://jane.groja.com
[ ] tomh.info
    As root:
      a2ensite 070-tomh.info.conf
      service apache2 stop
      service apache2 start
      l sites*/*.conf
    Should see the sites-available/070-tomh.info.conf file linked to
      the sites-enabled directory
    Access in browser:
      http://jane.tomh.info
So far so good, I hope.  And this is where the fun starts!

Finding the Right Copy of the Database
--------------------------------------
[ ] Databases used on barbara:
    NOTE: this is FOR REFERENCE ONLY - i.e., it is what we did LAST TIME
    groja.com & seeourminds.com:
      try using current db from lauren:
        seeourminds.com-2016_07_16-lauren.sql.gz
      try using current db from bette:
        seeourminds.com-2016_07_16-bette.sql.gz
    joomoowebsites.com: using db from bette (version 3.5.1)
        joomoowebsites.com-2016_07_16-bette-02-mobile_detect.sql.gz
    tomhartung.com: using db from bette
        tomwhartung.com-2016_07_16-bette.sql.gz

Overview of Process for CMS Sites
---------------------------------
1. Ensure it is working on barbara (or bette or lauren)
2. Copy code and db to jane
3. Ensure it works on jane
4. Cleanup: delete as many files as possible (downloads, old releases, tmp dirs., etc.)
5. Ensure it still works on jane
6. Copy code and db to ava
7. Ensure it works on ava
8. Consider cleaning up downloads, etc. on barbara as well

    -> using version from bette
    See ~/technical/cmses/drupal
[ ] Set ownership of cache files
    As root:
      cd sites/default
      chown -R www-data:www-data files
[ ] Enable site and restart apache

      l sites-*/*.conf
[ ] Log into back end and clear cache
    Browser:
      jane.tomhartung.com/admin -> Configuration -> Development -> Performance -> Clear all caches

Install Drush to Facilitate Drupal Site Updates
-----------------------------------------------
Site: tomhartung.com
[ ] Consider reviewing the following references for changes to the process:
    **Official official docs:**
      http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/
    **Official official process using composer:**
      http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install-alternative/
    Official drupal docs - uses composer and apt-get (last updated in 10/2015 though - before d8 and xenial 16.04):
      https://www.drupal.org/node/1248790   -- looks to be fairly outdated, but has info on how to get latest version
    High-level "second opinion:"
      http://tutorialforlinux.com/2015/05/16/how-to-install-drush-cli-for-drupal-8-on-ubuntu-15-04-vivid-32-64bit-gnulinux-easy-guide/
    Token stackexchange post (moral of the story: be sure to get the right version)
      http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/200539/drush-drush-dev-master-requires-codegyre-robo-1-0-0-beta1
    **This makes it seem easy, but I would bet you get an old old old version:**
      https://www.howtoinstall.co/en/ubuntu/xenial/drush - **We have decided to use this option**
[ ] Simulate install via apt-get, to see what it would do:
    As root:
      apt-get -s install drush
      ## The following NEW packages will be installed:
      ##   drush php-cli php-console-table php-mbstring php-mysql php7.0-mbstring
      ## ...
      ## Conf drush (5.10.0-2ubuntu1 Ubuntu:16.04/xenial [all])
--> Verified that these NEW packages are not currently installed, and wondering why
       they are not mentioned in the **Official official docs.**
[ ] Follow the **Official official docs:**
*********************************************
*** TRIED THIS METHOD AND IT DID NOT WORK ***
*** USING apt-get AS OTHER RESOURCES RECOMMEND
*** LEAVING POSSIBLE CRUFT ON JANE (e.g., in ~/.config/composer)
***************************************************
*** SKIP TO "Install Drush Using apt-get" BELOW ***
***************************************************
      http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/   - "official official docs home
    Specifically, follow the alternative process that uses composer
      http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install-alternative/
    Refer to the other references for confirmation, reassurances, and possible alternatives and troubleshooting techniques
[ ] Following steps in "Install a global drush"
    Following this process, from the **Official official docs:**
    Installing composer and drush into:
      /opt/bin
[ ] 1. Download and install composer globally:
    Top-level reference:
      https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally
    Commands to download composer:
      https://getcomposer.org/download/
    As tomh:
      cd ~/tmp
      mkdir install_composer
      php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
      php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'aa96f26c2b67226a324c27919f1eb05f21c248b987e6195cad9690d5c1ff713d53020a02ac8c217dbf90a7eacc9d141d') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
      ##
      ## "Installer verified"
      ##
      php composer-setup.php
      ## (output follows:)
      ## All settings correct for using Composer
      ## Downloading 1.2.2...
      ##
      ## Composer successfully installed to: /home/tomh/tmp/install_composer/composer.phar
      ## Use it: php composer.phar
      ##
      sudo mkdir /opt/bin
      sudo mv composer.phar /opt/bin/composer
      cd ..
      rmdir install_composer
      which composer  ## /opt/bin/composer
[ ] 2. Add composer's bin directory ($HOME/.composer/vendor/bin) to your PATH
    Done (in ~/.bash_aliases)
[ ] 3. Install latest stable Drush:
    As tomh:
      composer global require drush/drush
[ ] 4. Verify that Drush works:
    As tomh:
      drush status
    ## Output follows:
    ## The program 'drush' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
    ## sudo apt install drush
[ ] Following steps in "Install Drush for all users via Composer"
    ** THIS DID NOT WORK **
    Concerns:
    - Followed steps but no ~/.composer dir and no clue about installing the
        dependencies mentioned in the "apt-get -s" command output
    - Still want to get a more recent version than what apt-get will install
    - Double-checked (re-ran procedure given) with same results
    - I can see it put it into ~/.config/composer/vendor/drush/drush/
    As tomh:
      sudo mkdir --parents /opt/drush-8.x
      cd /opt/drush-8.x
      [sudo] [/opt/bin/]composer init --require=drush/drush:8.* -n
    Getting errors - with and without sudo and the path, eff this...

Install Drush Using apt-get
---------------------------
[ ] Falling back to the apt-get method:
    Keeping composer (in /opt/bin) and associated cruft (in ~/.config/composer) on jane, for
      possible future reference
    As tomh:
      sudo apt-get install drush
      which drush      ## /usr/bin/drush
      drush --version  ## drush version 5.10.0

Set up Alias to Run Correct Version of Drush
--------------------------------------------
[ ] Update: This version of drush does not work with Drupal 8
    For now:
      -> Use the version we installed on jane by setting up an alias (see below)
      -> Hope that because we keep the source on github, we will not need to use it on barbara and ava
[ ] Set up an alias so we can run the version of drush we installed yesterday:
    As tomh:
      alias 'drush'='~/.config/composer/vendor/drush/drush/drush'    ## add to ~/.bash_aliases-jane
      which drush       ## /usr/bin/drush
      alias drush       ## bash: alias: drush: not found
      drush --version   ## drush version 5.10.0
      . ~/.bash_aliases-jane
      which drush       ## /usr/bin/drush
      alias drush       ## alias drush='~/.config/composer/vendor/drush/drush/drush'
      drush --version   ## Drush Version   :  8.1.7
[ ] Stay tuned for more updates
