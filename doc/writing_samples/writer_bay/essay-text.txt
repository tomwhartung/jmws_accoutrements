Today, some people might feel that working fourty hours a week is similar to slavery.
This essay asserts that nothing could be further from the truth!

First, do the math.
There are 168 hours in a week, and fourty hours is less than one-fourth of this.
This fact makes the 24/7/365 obligation inherent in slavery more than four times worse than being a slave.

Second, look at the options.
Someone working fourty hours a week is free to quit and find a new job at anytime.
An employee can even flat out refuse to work for anyone whatsoever.
A slave does not have these options.

Third, consider the physical punishments.
Keeping slaves in chains was a standard practice.
Chains were made unnecessary only by severe psychological torment - specifically the threat of flogging and other types of punishments.

An owner could legally subject a slave to flogging for any infraction whatsoever.
There are stories of owners inflicting hundreds of lashes at a time.
This could kill the slave, and at best left them scarred - physically and emotionally - for life.

Sexual abuse was also a possibility.
As a slave, a woman could be raped repeatedly and ultimately forced to bear the child of her abuser, without any recourse whatsoever.

In contrast, today a boss inflicting any sort of physical punishment on full-time employee is liable to criminal prosecution.
Indeed, today a man who makes even a seemingly innocent comment about a woman's appearance can quickly become the defendant in a sexual harrassment lawsuit.

Today, financial and family obligations can make a person feel trapped in a job they don't like, but this is a far cry from slavery.
