Decided to not include these ideas in the marketing ebook.

## My Theories

**It may be best to present these ideas in an article on medium.**

### My Theory 1: Projection and Disappointment

My Theory 1:
- We project who we are on others
- We look for the qualities we see in fictional characters

The Game of Thrones Psychology book references some of these ideas, and attributes them
to a book entitled "Psychology in action."
Will be getting it from the library soon.

- We tend to look for who we are in others
- In my opinion, we tend to unconsciously project our tendencies preferences onto others
- That is, we expect others to do what we would do - unless there is a reason not to, such as until we get to know someone better
- Unless we have a reason to think otherwise, we tend to assume others have motivations and perceptions that are similar to ours
- When people do not make choices similar to ours, it can lead to communication problems and failed expectations
- This can be frustrating
  - E.g., for children who want to follow in a parent's footsteps, but are unsuited to do so
  - E.g., for marketers who think all people have similar perceptions and motivations

These are all real world consequences caused by people's failure to understand a few simple abstract principles.

### My Theory 2: ST Jobs at Risk of Automation

My Theory 2: Androids and AI Theory

- People who will like these images are more N and F
  - These people naturally seek out work that is less subject to being automated
- If you are more S and T, your occupation, no matter what it is, is at risk of automation
  - It is easy to give a machine sensory input, but difficult or impossible to give it ideas
  - Machines are made to be logical, it is difficult or impossible to give them emotions

Regardless of what type you are, if you are naturally drawn to work that is easily automated, wouldn't you want to know about it?
