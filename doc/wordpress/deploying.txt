 WordPress Deployment Notes:
=============================
When deploying, I am a big fan of copying the db on my development or test host to production.

This can cause issues, and specifically ...

Here is an important note that it took many hours to figure out!
----------------------------------------------------------------
WP stores a URL containing the canonical host name in the database.

o  E.g., http://bette.tomwhartung.com

This value is ALSO defined in the admin console under:

o  Admin -> Settings -> General -> WordPress Address (URL)
o  Admin -> Settings -> General -> Site Address (URL)

This value is ALSO defined in wp-config.php (near the end) as:

o  WP_HOME
o  WP_SITEURL

EVEN IF THESE VALUES ARE CORRECT, THE VALUE STORED IN THE DB MAY BE WRONG!  I KNOW!!!

This can cause issues when copying the DB between hosts.

The Fix
-------
How to fix issues where the WP site is looking for resources on a development or test host (due to copying the DB):

1. Access the Admin -> Settings -> General page
   Note that these values are NOT editable
2. Comment out the lines that define WP_HOME and WP_SITEURL in settings.php
3. Reload the Admin -> Settings -> General page
   Note that these values are NOW editable
4. Edit the settings in the Admin page (even if they are correct)
5. Scroll down and click Save Changes
6. Un-comment the lines that define WP_HOME and WP_SITEURL in settings.php

Good to know!
