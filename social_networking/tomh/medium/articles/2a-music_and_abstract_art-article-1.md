# Music, Meaning, and Modern Art: Part 1 of 3

This is part one of a three part series of articles written for people who love music but do not understand abstract art.

[Part two]() is about John Coltrane's [magnum opus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece) A Love Supreme and
[part three]() is about the Talking Heads' first four albums.

All three articles reference highly-acclaimed works of music and visual art that have stood the test of time.
The articles use these well-known works to help explain how musicians and painters use abstractions to add value and meaning to their work.

Depending on your interest level, you can read one, two, or all three of these articles.
All of them are about essentially the same thing, but each can stand on its own, so you can read them in any sequence you desire.

Spoiler alert: the secret is, when the meaning in a work of art is not immediately obvious, we are free to add our own meaning to it.

Sound complicated? It isn’t! All it takes is a little imagination.

## Exercising Your Imagination

Look at Kandinsky’s painting of The Blue Rider above and imagine:

1. A wildcat growling - in the distance
2. Two riders - instead of just the one
3. And they’re approaching - not riding off to the side
4. The sound of the wind - beginning to howl

Easy enough, right? Ok, now we’re ready!

## All Along the Watchtower

The song [All Along the Watchtower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower)
written by [Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan) but
covered most famously by [Jimi Hendrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY),
is a great example of a song with lyrics that are a bit vague.
Surely all music lovers love this song!

Based on the number of versions there are, it’s obvious that many musicians love it as well.

In addition to
[Bob’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jd3iytj9SDQ), and
Jimi’s versions - [in the studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY] and
[at Woodstock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvVz88IHK4o),
there are versions by
[Dave Matthews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOaMQ-R9YGM),
[Neil Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DBewzgXgYk),
[Eddie Vedder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHBSvpzI7Tw),
[John Mayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJlkkRub6MU),
[Pearl Jam and Neil Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePvmDGlE8XA),
[U2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx2re_YBki0),
[Eric Clapton and Lenny Kravitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fMvW_FtALU),
[Dave Mason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n3f8NeUm-k),
[Bruce Springsteen, Clarence Clemmons and Neil Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCVjDFR5xtg),
and even
[Bryan Ferry])https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqg4V4BmJj0)!

### The Joker and the Thief

Why do so many love this song?

[Link for lyrics: https://bobdylan.com/songs/all-along-watchtower/]

```
“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief
“There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth”
```

For one thing, there’s the music. There are only three chords so it’s easy to learn and jam to.
That certainly contributes to its appeal to musicians.

Blues songs also have only three chords, but this is no easy-going blues song.
The driving progression of the chords give those who hear a feeling of impending doom.

### Keep Calm and Trust Your Fate

Although the lyrics are a bit vague, they confirm that the shit is about to hit the fan!

```
“No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke
“There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late”
```

Ostensibly a conversation between a joker and a thief, the first two verses remain confusing, even after decades of consideration.
The only thing certain here is that the time stealing and kidding around is over.

### The Threat

The third and last verse finally reveal a specific threat!

```
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl
```

BOOM.  No more stealing, no more jokes.  No more joker, no more thief.
And if anything, the vague threat is even more vague now.  Surely it is something far worse than a couple of riders.
Oh-kay.

The scene is a bit more complete, but precisely when this is happening remains unclear.
Also, how are all these people going to fit in a typical
[watchtower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchtower).

How can a story so vague - so abstract, and even contradictory - also be so widely recognized as one of the greatest songs of all time?

#### It's BYO Meaning Art!

If you can love this song - which requires a bit of filling in the blanks - then you can love modern art.
Because whether you realize it or not, when you listen to this song, you are supplying details from - and
feeling emotions felt only in - your own life.

**A big part of understanding abstract art is realizing you have to bring your own meaning (BYOM).**

Once they established their own style, painters like Kandinsky and Picasso - and there are many others - did
not set out to create works like
[Rembrandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt) or
[Claude Monet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet).
Those works are beautiful, but they are specific, full of what Mondrian called "particular forms."

Rembrandt’s and Monet’s paintings are incredibly beautiful, but they are ultimately "just ballads."
[Me and My Uncle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAF0-EFCuG8)?
Nice, sure, but I'll take a 30-minute-plus long version of
[Dark Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyBs48VjMho)
any day!

We can all love All Along the Watchtower - because of rather than despite its vagueness - because
we have all been in a situation in which doom is impending!

Now, what if I told you that Picasso painted the aftermath of this apocalypse, decades before Bob Dylan wrote the song?

#### Picasso Painted the Aftermath!?

What happened after the impending doom came and the shit hit the fan for the people in Dylan's song?
The song doesn't yield any clue whatsoever.

When I try to envision the aftermath of the coming of the doom described in All Along the Watchtower, I see the painting
[Guernica](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/coleccion/obra/guernica)
by
[Pablo Picasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso).

It’s similarly structured: a jumble of recognizable forms that make it obvious that the shit has hit the fan!
No more jokers, thieves, princes, women, barefoot servants, or riders.
Even the horses those riders were on are done for!

There are easily several howling figures in this painting.
They may not be wildcats, but the feeling is undeniably the same.

Your vision of the aftermath of All Along the Watchtower might be the same, vaguely similar or it might be different.
Chances are, you never gave it a moment's thought till now.

Now you know how to see the beauty that modern art gives us.
It turns out it was hiding inside you all this time!

Outline for conclusion:
1. Compare and contrast Goya's Third of May, 1808 to Picasso's Guernica
-  For both: give background, context, and links to more information
-  Which one is more beautiful?
-  Which one is more informative?
-  Which one is more abstract?
-  Which one is more meaningful?
-  Which one is more accessible?
-  Which one do you prefer?
2. "Both of these are extremely powerful works of art that kind of say the same thing:"
- violence against people is horrifying
3. Post-aftermath: Mondrian's paintings showing equilibrium (maybe include an earlier, non-abstract work of his, e.g., pastoral scene)

#### BYOM: Filling in Mondrian's Blanks

What if I told you that the opposites in Piet Mondrian's paintings can represent any pair of opposites, whatsoever?

Image: images/Piet_Mondrian-1939-1942-Composition_10.jpg
Title and Attribution: Composition No. 10 - By Piet Mondrian, 1939-1942. Public Domain.
Link: https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=37643395

Take his Composition 10, for example.
Because this painting is so abstract and pure, the meaning of its elements is completely open to interpretation.

So, for example, the white areas could represent white people and the black areas could represent black people - or vice versa.
Or, the white areas could represent women and the black areas could represent men - or vice versa.
Or, the white areas could represent older people and the black areas could represent younger people - or vice versa.

Similarly, for example, the vertical lines could represent white people and the horizontal lines could represent
black people - or vice versa - and the white could just be the background.
Or, the vertical lines could represent women and the horizontal lines could represent men - or vice versa - and
the white could just be the background.
Or, the vertical lines could represent older people and the horizontal lines could represent younger people - or vice versa - and
the white could just be the background.

Or, the vertical lines could represent ______ and the horizontal lines could represent ______, and
the little colored boxes could represent ___ and ___ and ___!
Fill in the blanks as you see fit - human life is full of pairs of opposites!

And now you know the true nature of the power lying in Mondrian's Pure Neo-Plastic art!

#### I Want to Believe

The important thing to realize is that, no matter what identity we assign to the opposites in this painting,
each pair opposites - black vs. white, horizontal vs. vertical, etc. - is in non-symmetrical equilibrium.
I want to believe this means that eventually things will work out, and people will be able to live in equilibrium.

The song
[War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPZydAotVOY)
by
[Bob Marley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley)
confirms that this is how things will turn out - or else.

```
Until the philosophy which hold one race superior
And another, inferior,
Is finally, and permanently,
Discredited, and abandoned,
Everywhere is war
Me say war.
```

Plus, I have eyes, I can see what's going on - and

## Conclusion

Image: images/Wassily_Kandinsky-1914-Fugue.jpg
Title and Attribution: Fugue - By Wassily Kandinsky, 1914.
Link: http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/work-101.php

Certainly the fact that Kandinsky's Fugue represents a type of music
may have something to do with it selling in 1990 for $20,900,000.

Links to additional information about the image in the introduction, for possible use in the conclusion.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue
https://curiator.com/art/wassily-kandinsky/fuga-fugue
http://www.myswitzerland.com/nl-nl/fuga-fugue.html

The truly beautiful thing about abstract art is it can take on meanings that were not foreseen by the artist when they created the work.
For example, Pablo Picasso painted Guernica long before Bob Dylan wrote All Along the Watchtower.

-------------------------------

### In Conclusion

To be honest, when I first learned this I was a bit pissed off!
Of course, punk rock was huge at the time so everyone listening to that was a bit pissed off about something!

In this case, I was a bit pissed off that I hadn't learned this sooner.
- It all makes such total sense, in some ways it's like, "duh."
- Too bad teachers think it's more important to teach us about wars and the like.

But sometimes it's nice to have things spelled out in black and white.
Hopefully this helps you better appreciate abstract art!

# Copied From the Beginning

[Not sure whether we want to use this first-person stuff.]

When I first learned about abstract art, I was ready for it, because by then I had spent years listening to the
rich variety of music available in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.
The purpose of this article is to share with you the awakening I experienced in this regard in the art classes
I took at Virginia Commonwealth University [VCU](https://www.vcu.edu) in the mid-1980s.

If you have difficulty understanding how this painting, [Fugue](https://curiator.com/art/wassily-kandinsky/fuga-fugue),
created by Wassily Kandinsky in 1914 could
[sell at Sotheby's in 1990 for $20.9 million](http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/work-101.php), or
if you think Piet Mondrian's paintings are "just a bunch of squares," this article is for you!
