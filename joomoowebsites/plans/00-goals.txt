 Top Goals in Order of Importance
==================================
It really helps to be clear about these, especially if I am going to be seeking advice from others.

1. Resilience
-------------
Long life, willing to do the work I love for most of it, even to the very end.

2. Money
--------
We all need it, the more the better, BUT ...
Too much focus on this, and all of the other goals will suffer. (*)

3. Long-term Engagement
-----------------------
Want to keep up-to-date with changes and trends, and continue working in some capacity, indefinitely.  I enjoy working and, even more so, being a life-long learner, and want to do both as long as I can.

4. Work-Life Balance
--------------------
It's either free-lancing or full-time, except for maybe a short while
o Doing both in the long run is not desireable
o Hence preference for short-term projects (see 3-services file)

5. Self-actualization
---------------------
See 1-self-assessment .

(*) Balancing 2 and the Others Is Important
-------------------------------------------
Freelancing/self-employment can make that easier
  Spend part of the time using established skills for the money
  Spend art of the time: keeping up to date with changes and trends
