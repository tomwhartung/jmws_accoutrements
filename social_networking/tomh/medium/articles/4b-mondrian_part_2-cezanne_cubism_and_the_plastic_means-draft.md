Time to take the basic ideas I have for this new article on medium and turn them into a draft.

# Title

Proposed title for this article:

- The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian, Part 2: Cubism, Cezanne, and the Plastic Means

For reference, the title of the first article in the series was:

- The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian, Part 1: Equilibrium in Art and Life

This title may be a bit long, but whatevs....

# Goal

**Try to keep it short and sweet -- and focused on Mondrian's use of the term "plastic."**

# Basic Ideas -- Kind of an Outline

Some ideas are fleshed out better than others, meaning that some sentences could maybe be used as-is.

## Introduction

This is part 2, for part 1 see [link].

This article focuses on what Piet Mondrian means by the word "plastic," because that is essential to understanding Mondrian's writings.

## Plastic Means Versus Plastic Material

The New Art -- The New Life, The Collected Writings of Piet Mondrian, is a book edited and translated by Henry Holtzman and Martin S. James.
It was first published in 1986.

In the book the writings appear in chronological order.
In the past I've checked out copies of this book from the library, and read the articles somewhat randomly, picking those that had interesting-sounding titles.

Recently I obtained my very own copy of this book, and decided to take a more methodical approach, reading the articles in chronological order.

The articles in this book frequently use the term "plastic."

Indeed, he calls his work Neo-Plasticism, and this term appears in the title of many of his articles.

It is clear from the context that when Mondrian uses the word "plastic" he is not referring to the ubiquitous material appearing in many of today's products.

Context makes it somewhat clear that he uses the word "plastic" to refer to the way he constructs and composes his images.

But until recently, I was never really sure what he meant by the term.

This is one of the reasons I decided to read these articles in the proper sequence.

## Cubism and Cezanne

In their introductory articles, the editors and translators discuss how Cubism influenced Mondrian's early work.

- Quote from the article by Holtzman?
- Quote from the article by James?

I never really understood Cubism, so at one point I started reading the Cubist Epoch by Douglas Cooper, 1971.

It turns out that this book frequently mentions Cezanne, so I checked seven books about him out from the library.

[Mention curbside holds, and the fact that two people had to carry them out to me in my car?]

One of these books finally showed me exactly what is meant by "The Plastic Means."

## The Plastic Means

Section III in the book Cezanne's Composistions, by Earle Loran, 1943 is named An Illustrated Glossary, and defines this term.

It turns out, my guess regarding what the term means was fuzzy, but close.

Most significantly, this book compares Cezanne's paintings with photographs of his motifs.

These comparisons are incredibly valuable for those seeking to understand why Cezanne is considered the father of Modern Art.

## Mondrian's Use of the Word

In the first section of the article featured in the title of his Collected Works, The New Art -- The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships, Mondrian
uses the term repeatedly, with the assumption that the reader understands

This is arguably Mondrian's most enlightening article because draws parallels between his art and society at large.

- Societal Equilibrium
- High Universal Morality -- Peace on Earth

He uses the term "plastic" 15 times in the first 12 paragraphs.

- "plastic means:" 7 occurrences
- "plastic expression:" 5 occurrences
- "plastic value:" 3 occurrences

## Conclusion

It's difficult to find a definition of the word "plastic" that corresponds to Mondrian's use of the word.

Indeed, the index to the book Vision in Motion by L. Moholy-Nagy (1961) lists 19 occurrences of the term, but only the first mimics Mondrian's use of the term, while the other 18 references are to the material.

If you are interested in the language of composition in general, and in reading Mondrian's writings in particular, I highly recommend finding a copy of Erle Loran's book!
