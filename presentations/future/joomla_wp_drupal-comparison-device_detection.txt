 Adding Device Detection to Joomla, WordPress, and Drupal: Compare and Contrast
================================================================================

Adding options:
all are different, joomla (xml-based) more so than the others (array based)

Finding markup:
again, joomla is different, having a "mainline" in index.php
wp and drupal use templates, which is a little confusing at first, but easy enough once you get going
Drupal Reference: https://www.drupal.org/node/190815

Managing js and css:
Much more difficult than it should be!
It should be OK to just include a link tag.
But instead, each has its vastly different "super clever" way of doing things.  Uhg what a pain.

Summary/Conclusions:
