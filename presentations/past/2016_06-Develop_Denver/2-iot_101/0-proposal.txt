Categories (comma separated)
Internet of Things (IoT), Intel Edison, Arduino, C/C++, JavaScript, Node.js, Python

Description
Learn about programming the (largish) postage-stamp sized Intel Edison in Arduino (C/C++), JavaScript (Node.js), and Python (python2).

This language-agnostic presentation showcases a set of programs that demonstrate basic Internet of Things (IoT) functionality on the Intel Edison.

It starts with the basics, covering Digital Output, Digital Input, Analog Output via Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), and Analog Input.  It then covers some more advanced topics, including Inter Integrated Circuits (I2C) and using the Edison as a web server.

As the power of hardware grows exponentially, and the sizes of processor chips and peripherals shrink, forecasters are predicting strong growth for the IoT marketplace in the near future.  Now is the time to start familiarizing yourself with this landscape and begin thinking about what role you want to play in it.
