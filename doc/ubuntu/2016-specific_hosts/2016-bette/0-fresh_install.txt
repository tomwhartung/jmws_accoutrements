 Performing a Fresh Install
============================
Fresh install, trying to:
o keep 14.04 availiable and
o allow room for next version

 Install:
----------
[ ] Check checkboxes:
   [ ] Download updates while installing
   [ ] Install third-party software

Disk Partitions:
----------------
I always consider this to be the hardest part.

Overview:
o Use old partitions from previous Windows 7 install
o Skip allocating a separate /boot partition this time (I believe it doesn't really help anyting)

(*) Ran blkid command (as root) and got the following UUID block ids for these partitions:
   /dev/sda1: LABEL="Recovery" UUID="B8C0FF33C0FEF68A" TYPE="ntfs"
   /dev/sda2: LABEL="System Reserved" UUID="E454CA8654CA5AC6" TYPE="ntfs"
   /dev/sda3: UUID="2042E8A642E88240" TYPE="ntfs"
I feel confident that these UUIDs will change when the partitions are reformatted, and
moreover there is no reason to mount them in 14.04 at this time.
However, we could certainly do that when we're done, i.e., mounting sda1 to /ubuntu-16.04/ and
sda3 to /ubuntu-16.04/home , if we desire to do so.
