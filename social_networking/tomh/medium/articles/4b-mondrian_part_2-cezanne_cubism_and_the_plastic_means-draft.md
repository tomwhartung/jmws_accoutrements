Time to take the basic ideas I have for this new article on medium and turn them into a draft.

**Try to keep it short and sweet -- and focused on Mondrian's use of the term "plastic."**


# The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian, Part 2: Cubism, Cezanne, and the Plastic Means

This is part 2 of a series of articles about the work of the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian, 1872-1944.
For part 1 see [The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian, Part 1: Equilibrium in Art and Life](https://medium.com/@tomwhartung/the-prophetic-vision-of-piet-mondrian-part-1-equilibrium-in-art-and-life-c2b7ba006fd5)

This article focuses on what Piet Mondrian means by the word "plastic," because that is essential to understanding Mondrian's writings.

## Mondrian's Collected Writings

The New Art -- The New Life, The Collected Writings of Piet Mondrian, is a book edited and translated by Henry Holtzman and Martin S. James first published in 1986.
Holtzman and James divide their book into three parts, and in it Mondrian's writings appear in chronological order.

One of these works is The New Art -- The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships, which Mondrian first completed in December, 1931.
It is arguably Mondrian's most enlightening work because it draws parallels between his art and society at large.
This explains its use in the title of his Collected Writings.

In the past I've checked out copies of this book from the library, and read the articles and essays somewhat randomly, picking out those with the most interesting-sounding titles.
Recently I obtained my very own copy of this book, and decided to take a more methodical approach, reading the articles in the sequence in which he wrote them.

## Plastic Means Versus Plastic Material

Throughout his writings Mondrian frequently uses the term "plastic."
Indeed, he refers to the style of his work as the "New Plastic" or "Neo-Plasticism," and this term appears in the title of many of his articles.

In fact, Mondrian called his first book, which was published as a collection of essays, "The New Plastic in Painting."
He began writing it in 1914 and it appeared in twelve installments in the first issues of the journal De Stijl, between October 1917 and October 1918.

While reading his collected writings, I have found the term "plastic" to be a consistent stumbling block.
It is clear from the context that when Mondrian uses the word he is not referring to the ubiquitous material used to make many of today's products.

Context makes it somewhat clear that he uses the word "plastic" to refer to the way he constructs and composes his images.
For example, one of the chapters in this first book is entitled "The New Plastic as Abstract-Real Painting: Plastic Means and Composition."

One of the reasons I decided to read these articles in the proper sequence was that I was hoping to find a definition of the term, or at least learn to be more comfortable with it when I encountered it.
Naturally, if one wants to learn something, it makes sense to start at the beginning.

Unfortunately, he never really defines the term, and until recently, I was never really 100% sure what he meant by the it.
Although I had a sense of what he meant, it would be difficult to try to explain it to somene.

It became clear that I had to back up to and learn about the artists who inspired Mondrian: Paul Cezanne and the Cubists.

## Cubism and Cezanne

In their introductory articles, the editors and translators discuss how Cubism influenced Mondrian's early work.

In his introductory article "Piet Mondrian: The Man and His Work" Harry Holtzman writes:

Mondrian saw Cubism as the new awareness of the intrinsic means of plastic expression, as the destruction of the naturalistic and the mimetic, as the conscious
construction of the picure-plane, as the dynamic rhythm of its composition of forms in space.  [p. 8.]

In his introductory article "Piet Mondrian: Art and Theory to 1917" Martin S. James writes:

Cubism, Mondrian repeatedly stressed, opened the way for the New Plastic.  Shortly after seeing examples of early Cubist work by Picasso and Braque at the Monderne
Kunstkring in late 1911, he settled in Paris.  His analytical Cubist "compositions" of 1912-13 in grays and browns were based on a favorite motif, the tree, where
particular forms disappear almost completely in the whole.  [p. 14.]

I never really understood Cubism, so at one point I started reading the Cubist Epoch by Douglas Cooper, 1971.

It turns out that this book frequently mentions Cezanne, so I checked seven books about him out from the library.

[Mention curbside holds, and the fact that two people had to carry them out to me in my car?]

One of these books finally showed me exactly what is meant by "The Plastic Means."

## The Plastic Means

Section III in the book Cezanne's Composistions, by Earle Loran, 1943 is named An Illustrated Glossary, and defines this term.

It turns out, my guess regarding what the term means was fuzzy, but close.

Most significantly, this book compares Cezanne's paintings with photographs of his motifs.

These comparisons are incredibly valuable for those seeking to understand why Cezanne is considered the father of Modern Art.

## Mondrian's Use of the Word

In the first section of the article featured in the title of his Collected Works, The New Art -- The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships, Mondrian
uses the term repeatedly, with the assumption that the reader understands


- Societal Equilibrium
- High Universal Morality -- Peace on Earth

He uses the term "plastic" 15 times in the first 12 paragraphs.

- "plastic means:" 7 occurrences
- "plastic expression:" 5 occurrences
- "plastic value:" 3 occurrences

## Conclusion

It's difficult to find a definition of the word "plastic" that corresponds to Mondrian's use of the word.

Indeed, the index to the book Vision in Motion by L. Moholy-Nagy (1961) lists 19 occurrences of the term, but only the first mimics Mondrian's use of the term, while the other 18 references are to the material.

If you are interested in the language of composition in general, and in reading Mondrian's writings in particular, I highly recommend finding a copy of Erle Loran's book!
