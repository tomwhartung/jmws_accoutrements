== Enclosure ==

Included with the release is a single sheet folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure.  This enclosure slides out of the case, enabling its front page to also function as the CD's cover.  The back of this enclosure features a white outline of a circular [[Steal Your Face|stealie skull]] super-imposed on a mostly blue [[bird's-eye view|bird's-eye photographic view]] of some snow-covered trees, partially lit by the sun so that it looks like it was taken in the morning or evening.

Inside the enclosure, the page on the left side lists the shows' venue, location and dates, the band's members, production credits, tracks on the two CDs, and copyright information.  The page on the right side features a blue-on-orange publicity poster for the shows.  Entitled "Grateful dead morning glory", the poster includes the dates, location, and ticket price for the shows, "$3.00 [in] advance, $3.50 at the door."  The center of the poster features a skeleton skiing downhill at night while wearing an orange scarf.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 22, 2001.</ref>
