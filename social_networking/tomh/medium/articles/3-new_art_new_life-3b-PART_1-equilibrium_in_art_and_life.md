After giving it some thought, I have decided to write a series of articles, focusing the first of them on Mondrian's notion of equilibrium.

# Ultimate Goal of This Article

To be able to reference this article in a subsequent article about my vision.

### Sub-title: "Part 1: Equilibrium in Art and Life"

This is Part 1 in an series of occasional articles about why Piet Mondrian went from painting
[representational images]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(arts) ) to painting
[abstract images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art).
His writings reveal his reasons for this progression.  These writings are profound and enlightening, but can be difficult to understand.

This article focuses on the parallels he saw between the evolution of his art and the progress of culture and life itself.
Subsequent articles will be about some of the other ideas - such as equilibrium, liberation, and high
universal morality - described in his writings.

[Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) was born to Johanna Christina de Kok and Pieter Cornelis Mondriaan sr.
in 1872, in the town of [Amersfoort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amersfoort) in the
[Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands).  He started painting at an early age and in 1892 entered the
[Academy for Fine Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksakademie_van_beeldende_kunsten) in
[Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam).

Mondrian's early works were representational - landscapes containing fields, rivers, windmills, and the like.
His Evening; Red Tree (Avond; De rode boom) from 1908–1910 and the 1909 painting View from the Dunes with Beach and Piers, Domburg are
examples of his work at this time.

### Theosophism, Cubism, and De Stijl

In 1909 he joined the [Theosophical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophical_Society).
[Theosophists](https://www.theosophical.org/) "encourage open-minded inquiry into world religions, philosophy, science, and the
arts in order to understand the wisdom of the ages, respect the unity of all life, and help people explore spiritual self-transformation."

One could say theosophists taught themselves how to "think outside the box" long before it was even a thing, much less cool.

The 1910s were transformative for Mondrian.  It is fascinating to view his paintings during this period in chronological order.

Using terms from his writings, it was during this time that he abandoned "particular forms" completely.
By the end of the decade his paintings became so abstract that all representation was “annihilated.”

His work [from 1910 through 1914](http://www.abcgallery.com/M/mondrian/mondrian-2.html) shows how his representative works became more
and more geometric until they were totally abstract.  Some of his paintings, such as Still Life With Gingerpot I and II,
show a trend towards the [Cubist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism) style for which artists such as
[Georges Braque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Braque)
and [Pablo Picasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso) are most well-known.

The Netherlands was neutral in World War I, but it raged from 1914-1918 in other parts of Europe.
It was during the war, in 1917, that Mondrian joined several other painters and architects there in founding an art movement called
[De Stijl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl) - Dutch for "The Style."

And it was during this time, [from 1916 through 1921](http://www.abcgallery.com/M/mondrian/mondrian-3.html), that he developed the
distinctive, ["neoplastic"](http://the-artists.org/artistsbymovement/neo-plasticism) style for which he is most famous.

### The New Art — The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships

Most of his paintings from the 1920s on were reduced to only the essential elements.
They contained only black perpendicular lines and rectangles painted in primary colors on a white background. 

He called this type of painting Pure Neo-Plasticism, his goal was to compose these
essential elements so that these opposites of color and form would exist in equilibrium.
The evolution in his paintings is interesting, but his writings - which explain his perceptions and reasons for creating
this style - are fascinating.

Piet Mondrian completed his book - *The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships* -
in 1931, but by then had been working on it since at least 1921.  It is short but profound and abstract - so much so that
[The Collected Works of Piet Mondrian,](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Art-Life-Collected-Twentieth-Century/dp/0306805081)
published in 1987, bears the same title.

In this work Mondrian reveals how he believed that art and life follow similar paths:

> In life every sincere effort leads to human evolution, and it is the same in art.  Rightly seen, there
> remains *a single path of evolution* that, regardless of time, *is identical for life and for art....*
>
> This fact that art demonstrates is of great importance for life, because it forms the basis of progress and shows its path.
 - Piet Mondrian, The New Art, The New Life, 1931. [Emphasis in original.]

This realization is key to seeing how Mondrian's vision was prophetic.

Mondrian claims that just as art has evolved into a composition containing opposites of form and color in
equilibrium, so will future society.  If at first this notion seems preposterous, it takes only a moment’s thought to
realize that society and everyday life are rife with opposites:

> The rhythm of the straight line in rectangular opposition indicates *the need for equivalence* of these two aspects in life:
*the equal value of the material and spiritual, the masculine and feminine, the collective and individual, etc.*
Just as the vertical line differes in character from the horizontal, so in life the two aspects have their inherent and opposed character.
But just as in art these lines have different dimensions, so individuals and their groups differ in strength or size.
*Art demonstrates that life, through equivalence of its opposed aspects - despite their different nature - can approach real equilibrium.*

---

Those who instinctively understand this tendency towards equilibrium are likely to feel concern for the current trend of increasing
income inequality.

He also believed the path that art and life follow is one of purification and equilibrium of opposites:
> If art is an expression of life and anticipates it, we can state that the new life is *the culture of equivalent relationships.*  Just as with the plastic means in art, it is evident that for this life our mentality must become more or less purified, not in an old-fashioned puritanical way, but so as to rise above the oppression of limiting, particular forms.  Thus in the same way as art, life reaches a state of real equilibrium *through pure and equivalent relationships of increasingly free individuals.*


---

Understanding this, in turn, requires understanding the difference between equality, harmony, and what he called equilibrium.

### [(Possible) Conclusion]

This short book was not published during his lifetime.
I believe this is because he was so far ahead of his time.
It is also so abstract that it is difficult to understand - even for me, and I love abstract stuff!
