 Adding Device Detection to Joomla, WordPress, and Drupal: Compare and Contrast
================================================================================

Why do this?
Because it's there.
It is difficult to imagine someone paying someone else to do something like this.
It does not make much business sense.

Adding options:
all are different, joomla (xml-based) more so than the others (array based)

Finding markup:
again, joomla is different, having a "mainline" in index.php
wp and drupal use templates, which is a little confusing at first, but easy enough once you get going
Drupal Reference: https://www.drupal.org/node/190815

Managing js and css:
Much more difficult than it should be!
It should be OK to just include a link tag.
But instead, each has its vastly different "super clever" way of doing things.  Uhg what a pain.

Summary/Conclusions:
I was able to use quite a bit of code, more than expected, on all three.
Not a fan of the draconian drupal code standards.  Makes using the same IDE for wp a pain (have to change the options all too frequently).
Making use of inheritance in separating what works for all of them from the CMS-specific functionality, is huge fun for me.
Adding the jQuery Mobile data role attributes was particularly fun (same for all, but go in different places, so easy and hard at the same time).
