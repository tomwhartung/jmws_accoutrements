 My Hosts and Their Purposes
=============================
My main dev host jane is acting up, making the '/' filesystem read-only,
segfaulting on "df" commands and the like.

This means that barbara, which was destined to be the new production host,
is now taking over that role, at least temporarily.

It also means that we will be buying a new computer for the production
host role, probably this weekend.

List of Hosts and the Updates Needed
------------------------------------
=-> ava - Ubuntu 16.04 server - production host, setup from scratch ASAP
=-> jane - Ubuntu 16.04 desktop - new disk, re-setup from scratch (and backups) ASAP
-> lauren - Ubuntu 14.04 desktop - upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 when we get ava into production
-> bette - Ubuntu 14.04 desktop - upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 when we get ava is done & grojas working in a VM
barbara - Ubuntu 16.04 desktop - test, staging, and backup development and production - ok for now!
