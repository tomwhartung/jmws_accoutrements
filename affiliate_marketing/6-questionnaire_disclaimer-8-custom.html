<h2>Quiz Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The SeeOurMinds.com quiz makes absolutely <em>no</em> attempt to diagnose mental health issues, and should not be understood as providing any type of diagnosis or healthcare recommendation.</p>
<p>Our questionnaire is intended to be fun and educational, and it may help increase your awareness of your subconscious psychological preferences, but it is not intended to be a tool for diagnosing any type of health or mental health condition.</p>

<h2>Quiz Accuracy</h2>
<p>The SeeOurMinds.com quiz is a work in progress, and at this time I am not by any means ready to guarantee that it will give you an accurate result!</p>

<h3>If accuracy is important to you...</h3>
<p>If accuracy is important to you, please take other quizzes and get a variety of opinions. And if you really want to learn exactly what your four letter type is, by all means take the real MBTI® instrument!</p>

<h2>Sharing Your Email Address</h2>
<p>Sharing your email address on the quiz page enables you to save your answers on our server and retrieve, change, and add to them when you return.</p>
<p>Note: sharing your email address on the quiz page does NOT sign you up for our newsletter! To do that, use the form in the aside that is labeled specifically for that purpose.</p>

<h2>Other Resources</h2>
<p>Self-administered psychological screening tests may help to enhance self-awareness of one’s own experiences, but what any individual chooses to do &mdash; or ‘should’ choose to do &mdash; with the results of any given test, is a matter for the individual to decide and should not be dictated by the test itself.</p>
<p>This section contains resources for people who are concerned about the mental health of themselves or others.</p>
