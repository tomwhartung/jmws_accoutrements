Today, some people might feel that working fourty hours a week is similar to slavery.
This short essay asserts that nothing could be further from the truth!

First, do the math.
There are 168 hours in a week, and fourty hours is less than one-fourth of this.
This fact makes the 24/7/365 obligation inherent in slavery more than four times worse than being a full-time employee.

Second, compare the options of a full-time employee to those of a slave.
Someone working fourty hours a week is free to quit and find a new job at anytime, and can even refuse to work for anyone whatsoever.
A slave does not have these options.

Third, consider the physical punishments.
Keeping slaves in chains was a standard practice, made unnecessary only by the constant threat of severe physical torture.

A slave owner can legally subject a slave to flogging for any infraction whatsoever.
There are stories of owners inflicting hundreds of lashes at a time.
This could actually kill the slave, and at best left them scarred - physically and emotionally - for life.

Depending on the owner's temperament, sexual abuse was also a possibility.
As a slave, a woman could be raped repeatedly, and even ultimately forced to bear the child of her abuser, without any recourse whatsoever.

In contrast, today a boss who inflicts any sort of physical punishment on a full-time employee is liable to criminal prosecution.
More than that, a man who makes even a seemingly innocent comment about a woman's appearance these days can find himself the defendant in a sexual harrassment lawsuit.

The notion that someone working fourty hours a week is a slave is preposterous.
Although financial and family obligations might make a person feel trapped in a job they don't like, this is a far, far cry from slavery.

Anyone claiming a similarity between the two is only revealing their complete ignorance of the horrors of slavery, most likely stemming from a tendency towards self-pity.
