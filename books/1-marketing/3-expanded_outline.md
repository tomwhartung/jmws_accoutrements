# Preface: It's Really Quite Simple

The thought of visualizing a personality sounds strange at first, but it's really quite simple.

## Observations and Choices

Every living thing is constantly:

- Observing: perceiving, gathering and assimilating information, and
- Doing things: making decisions based on our observations - and observing the results

Even when we are going through the motions on a typical day, even when dreaming,
we are either observing or doing something - or both.

Sometimes - such as when we are using muscle memory and on automatic pilot - we
can even be doing both at the same time!

## Preferences Happen

Every living thing - animals and more recently even some machines - has
a preference for either observing or doing something.

This preference may be subconscious, and it **may be great or slight.**

To create a spiritual portrait I combine a person's
preference for observing or choosing with a few other,
similar preferences into what I call a "Groja[footnote]".

## Abstract Personalities, Abstract Preferences, Abstract Images

Personalities are abstract - an idea we get about people whom we get to know.

Preferences are an abstraction - generalizations based on multiple
instances - based on the observations and decisions made over the
course of a lifetime.

Visualizing a personality based on a person's
preferences requires using an abstract image.

It's really just that simple.


# Chapter 1: Introduction

[Include one of my self-portraits here.]

Hi, my name is Tom Hartung and I tend to prefer observing to deciding.

So it's only natural for me to ask a lot of questions.
Here are a handful that I am thinking about right now:

- How well do you know yourself?
- Do you ever wonder why other people aren't more like you?
- Are you as happy as you could be?
- Do you ever wonder where other people are coming from?
- Could your relationships be better?
- Would you like to know why some people just rub you the wrong way, right from the start?
- Do you go through life without direction, just responding to things, like flotsam?

The next section explains how having an image of your personality - something
I call a "spiritual portrait" or "Groja"[footnote] - can help answer these questions.


# Chapter 2: Why You Might Want an Image of Your Personality

[This section should address **all** questions in the previous section.]

The fact that we are all going to die is a big reason you might
want to get your spiritual portrait!

These images also offer insight into your personality and how you
relate to other people, both real and fictional.

Spiritual portraits can also provide a framework for better mindfulness,
help you identify the type of work you are best suited for, and
give you instant feedback on the strength of your preferences.

## Death - Yours and Mine

If **you** die without getting your spiritual portrait, no one will
ever know what it looks like.

These portraits are based on the answers to a questionnaire, and
you cannot answer the questions when you are dead.
Someone else could answer them for you, but **their answers will
never be as accurate as yours.**

The result will at best be only an imitation, not the real thing.

Also: if **I** die before you get your spiritual portrait, it will be only
an imitation, not the real thing.

I have been drawing personalities like this for over forty years.
When I am gone, someone **might** take an interest in this project and
they **might** be able to replicate my process, but I am the only
person who can create the real thing.

[**Key point**]
The best way to get the most accurate image of your personality is for me to
make your spiritual portrait while we are both still alive.

## Insight Into Yourself and others

As we go through life, all of us are of necessity expressing these
preferences, and demonstrating the resultant personality traits
in our daily actions.
And many of us are already subconsciously processing this information,
to varying degrees.

Spiritual portraits make these invisible personality traits visible.
This means having your spiritual portrait allows you to better understand:

- Why we do the things we do
- Where others are coming from
- Why we relate better to some people - both real and fictional - than to others
- What can cause difficulties we have with some types of people to happen again and again

[**Key point**]
People are aware of their preferences to varying degrees.
Regardless of how well you know yourself, being able to visualize
your personal preferences in a Groja[footnote] is incredibly enlightening.

## Are You Too Busy - or Afraid of the Unknown?

My spiritual portraits are reasonably priced, so what do you have to lose?

For many people, answering a questionnaire may seem like too much work.
It may bring back unpleasant memories of the quizzes, tests, and exams we
suffered through in school.

For others, I have another theory: some people are afraid of their own subconscious.

### Fear

Are you afraid of your own subconscious?
Regrettably, I feel some people are.

Do you prefer to go through life "naturally?"
Are you afraid that seeing your spiritual portrait might reveal a "dark side?"

There is nothing unnatural about a spiritual portrait.
One of my images will never reveal whether you are good or bad - but it
can reveal your motivations, which may be subconscious - for being the way
you are.

[**Key point**]
If you prefer to just coast through life, responding instinctively
rather than consciously to whatever it throws at you, you will not
appreciate having your spiritual portrait.

## Mindfulness

Bringing unconscious information to the surface in general and
mindfulness in particular is becoming increasingly popular - and
for a good reason.

We now have more options than ever before for how to spend our time more,
so it's important to make the best of the limited time we have here.

Some people are more aware than others of the power of their
perceptions and the impacts of their decisions.
This awareness tends to increase as we get older - particularly if we
start being more mindful of our observations and actions - and we
feel good about improving ourselves by learning from our mistakes.

But mindfulness is not for everyone.
Indeed, some people steadfastly refuse to learn from their mistakes,
thinking that somehow shows they are weak.

[**Key point**]
Spiritual portraits can give mindfulness a fresh framework for understanding
who we are and how we might improve.

## Finding Work That Matches Your Personality?

Spiritual portraits can help you learn what sort of work you are best suited for.
For example, if you are naturally drawn to work that is easily automated,
wouldn't you want to know about it?

But if you take a little time to learn what the questionnaire results
and the image means, it will help you identify what type of jobs
will be easiest for you.

[**Key point**]
You can't just input your preferences and have the perfect career pop out,
but a little self-knowledge can go a long way when it comes to understanding
your strengths and weaknesses.

## The Hazards of Extreme Personalities

Spiritual portraits reflect not just a person's preferences but also
the strength of them.

People with mild preferences are very different from those with strong
preferences - and the images reflect those qualities.
In particular, images of personalities with strong preferences show
a predominance of a single color, making them visible immediately.

In her book **Gifts Differing,** Meyers-Briggs [footnote]
repeatedly cautions that a strong supporting function is
essential for all personality types.

For example, some people prey on those who are gullible - those
who have a preference for observing rather than doing things.
Likewise, someone with a preference for doing things while
refusing to consider the consequences or listen to others can
be regarded as stubborn.

[**Key Point**]
The images reflect the strength of the preferences, and
strong preferences can make a person vulnerable.

# Chapter 3: What the Images Represent

[Don't go too deep - for details refer them to the How-to.]
[It's ok to expand on ideas hinted at in the Prologue, because some
people will skip the Prologue entirely.]

#### What do you do?

[Note: it's ok to repeat what's in the Prologue, some people may skip it.]

What do you do in your life?

No matter who you are, you:

Open ourselves to observing things
- See, hear, touch, smell, and taste
  - Even animals and machines can do these things
- After awhile, we begin to see patterns and get ideas
  - In general humans are better at these things than animals and machines

Process our observations to make decisions
- Many decisions are subconscious: reflexive, instinctive, and habitual
- After awhile, we develop a tendency to:
  - Make logical decisions that are consistent and determined by external circumstances
  - Make emotional decisions that can vary and are determined by how we feel at the moment
  - Consciously consider both alternatives and pick the one best suited to the situation

In most people, one of these - observing or deciding - takes precedence.
In a minority of people - I call them "chameleonesque" - these tendencies are balanced.

Finally, people tend to direct their dominant preference either outwardly or inwardly.

#### What do the images represent?

- Introduce what Grojas are:
  - The images must be abstract because personalities are abstract
  - They are based on Jungian Achetypes
    - Myers Briggs codified and commercialized Jung's typology, and adapted his methodology into the popular four-letter type shorthand
- What each of the colors represent
  - Refer to About page on Groja.com, **do not duplicate it**
    - Possibly refer to Appendix, where there might be more information
  - Sensing-Yellow versus iNtuition-Blue
    - Three or more adjectives for each, at least one each positive, neutral, and negative
    - N vs. S - Perceptions
      - As different as night and day
      - The biggest differences between people
  - Thinking-Green versus Feeling-Red
    - Three or more adjectives for each, at least one each positive, neutral, and negative
    - F vs. T - Motivations
      - Warm vs. Cool
      - The source of most difficulties between people
- What the horizontal and vertical lines represent
  - These images use:
    - Vertical lines to represent the preference the person directs outwardly
    - Horizontal lines to represent the preference the person directs inwardly
  - When the dominant function is directed outwardly, the image contains a long vertical line to the left of the image's center
    - These are extraverts and it is usually quickly obvious who they are
  - When the dominant function is directed inwardly, the image contains a long vertical line underneath the image's center
    - These are introverts and it often takes some time to learn who they are
  - When a person's preferences are very strong, these lines may get lost, but they are there


# Chapter 4: People Who Would Appreciate a Spiritual Portrait the Most

How to determine whether you would like to see your Spiritual Portrait.

- World's Shortest Personality Quiz - or Something
  - Instant Personality Quiz?
  - Two questions, pick where you are on the continuum
    - Use at least positive, neutral, and negative synonym on each side
    - Use the colors subtlely in the continuum - a gradient with white in the middle might be nice
    - S ------- N - where are you, on a scale of 1-10?
    - T ------- F - where are you, on a scale of 1-10?
  - What your score means:
    - If your score is 10 or more, you will like your spiritual portrait
      - The higher your score, the better chance you will like it
    - If your score is less than 10, a spiritual portrait is not for you
      - The lower your score, the less probability you will like it

- How it works
  - Personality traits and images of personalities are abstract
    - If you are more N than S,
    - If you are more Blue than Yellow,
    - If you prefer ideas to facts,
    - If you are more comfortable with abstractions than most,
    - Then you will understand the images more easily
  - Personality traits and images of personalities are all about people
    - If you are more F than T,
    - If you are more Red than Green,
    - If you prefer emotions to logic,
    - If you'd rather work with people than things,
    - Then you will understand the images more easily


# Chapter 5: Conclusion - The Pitch

**Review Daniel Pink's book before completing this section.**

## Benefits

Grojas can help with:

- Self-awareness
- Relationships - personal & professional teams - explain how briefly
- Etc. - review salient points from the Selling Points section.

## Pricing

Pricing is variable.
If you see us running a special offer, you would be wise to take advantage of it.

- Increased demand:
  - May well drive up the price of hand-crafted images
  - May push me to better automate production, so the price will always be reasonable
- Images of similar personalities will look similar, but no two images will never be identical


# Appendix: How to Draw a Personality

This will be **the definitive, detailed How-to,** to be excerpted from and adapted into articles for posting on social networking sites.

So it's ok to delve into details.  Dive away!

Consider doing all or portions of this as an infographic - see TODOs below.

- Choose what qualities you want to portray
  - For example, Jungian, Big 5, something from the DSM, etc.
- Find a questionnaire
  - Find an existing questionnaire that is OK to use, or write your own, or both
- Decide how to represent the qualities
  - For example, what shapes and colors to use for these traits, what types vectors for those traits, etc.
- Consider writing a program to do the work
  - Writing a program to convert the results to an image is **not** necessary, but it makes it easy to create consistent images
- Obtain personality profiles and draw them!
  - Get people to answer the questionnaire

- TODOs:
  1. Adapt this into an infographic and post to pinterst
  2. Adapt this How-to into an article and post to medium
