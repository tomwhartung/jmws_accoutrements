Updating ArtsyVisions.com .

# Technical Updates

This site is OK technically and I was able to run it locally by installing django and adding a `gitignored/Site/Site/settings.py` file.

# Content Updates

- [x] Remove free spiritual portrait offer from Home and all Vision pages
- [x] Change name of newsletter from "Monthly" to "Intermittent"

# Review

- [x] Ensure social media icons link to correct accounts.
- [x] Review for anything glaring

# Adding Goodreads Icon

The goodreads icon is not in the set of icons I am using - i.e., Font Awesome 4.7.0.

To get the latest required creating an account on their site.

Here is the script tag that includes my access code:

```
<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/3ee519bdc8.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

This enabled me to add an icon for goodreads to the home page.
