# jmws_accoutrements

Repo for JooMooWebSites documentation, scripts, presentations, and other files that can help us when working with Jmws code, but are not CMS-specific, and in most cases not even "deliverables."

* bin/ contains some database backup and restore and afew scripts I use for deployment
* doc/ contains some simple documentation for devops and processes, and the popular cmses drupal, joomla, and wordpress
* presentations/ contains slides etc. for some presentations I've done
