==Enclosure and liner notes==

This release includes a single sheet of paper folded into thirds, yielding six pages that fit snugly inside the CD case.  The front matches the cover on the CD, and inside this are two pages containing the track listing along with photos of the band members.

Following this is the first page of a two-page article, which also functions as the back cover.  The article continues on the back of the sheet, and appearing between that and the front cover of the enclosure is a picture of a skeleton dressed in black leather riding a [[Chopper (motorcycle)]] against a background of clouds that merges seamlessly with the clouds on the front cover.

=== Liner notes ===
Michael Nash wrote the liner notes on 12/29/97 â€“ the twentieth anniversary of the show featured on the release.  The title of it is "Remembrance of things past (and yet, still present)" and the subtitle is " 'We're gonna try to get everything just exactly perfect ... on account of our new name is the Just Exactly Perfect Brothers Band.' "  [Ellipsis in original.]

The beginning of the article provides context for the show, describing Winterland in mythical terms: "the funky former ice palace was, in fact, Valhalla, where Odin sat in the top row, proudly watching his titans shake the firmament and tear the roof off the joint."  Nash goes on to say that in late 1977 "the music grew muscles and developed a Popeye-like swagger", this was "the second gig of [a] four-night stand", and "All night long, Garcia seemed more than willing to risk hitting the occasional bad note in order to find the ones no one else could imagine."

About two-thirds of the way through, the author switches to italics for three full paragraphs to describe the highlight of the show, the series of songs that starts and ends with [[Playing in the Band]].  In this set of songs, he makes it clear that [[China Cat Sunflower]] was most welcome, because it had been "unheard on stage for over three years."  Nash closes the article by asserting "the applause echoes still" and that being there "didn't make us cool.  Just thrilled."<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 10, 1998.</ref>
