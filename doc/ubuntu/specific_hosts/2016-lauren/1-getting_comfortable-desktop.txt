 Getting Comfortable

Install the basic stuff we need to get around and do the other stuff.

Lauren is our oldest PC and the plan is to use it only for social networking.

/usr/local/bin and ~/bin Setup
------------------------------
[ ] Setup pythonLibs in ~ (/home/tomh) and /usr/local/bin
    This is now needed for scripts like up, killEmAll, and upapa
    ** The whole /usr/local/bin setup needs to be re-examined **
    ** npm likes to put stuff there too! **
    We don't need all of these, but it's nice to have a local copy of them anyway
    As tomh:
      cd
      mkdir -p iot/customizations
      cd iot/customizations
