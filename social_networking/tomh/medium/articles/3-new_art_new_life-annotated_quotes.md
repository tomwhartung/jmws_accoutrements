## The New Art - The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships (1931)

Written over a period of three years, based on ideas developed over the previous decade, but never published during his lifetime.

> If art is an expression of life and anticipates it, we can state that the new life is *the culture of equivalent relationships.*
> Just as with the plastic means in art, it is evident that for this life our mentality must become more or less purified,
> not in an old-fashioned puritanical way, but so as to rise above the oppression of limiting, particular forms.
> Thus in the same way as art, life reaches a state of real equilibrium
> *through pure and equivalent relationships of increasingly free individuals.*
(p. 248)

- **Progress**
- **Diversity**
- **Purified Forms**
- I see parallels between what he is saying in the next quote, about subject and particular form,
in the (supposed) trend to ignoring demographics (race, gender, age, etc.) in hiring.
In reality, progress in this area has been made, but there is still a ways to go.
> Today we see subject and particular form, once of such great importance in the work,
> rejected not only as being a primitive means of expression, but also as limiting expression.
> Until now their use has been prolongd by tradition and necessity - equally by convention and inertia.
(p. 249)

- **General/Best**
- **Progress**
- In this evolution of art and life it is sincerity, rather than conformity, that matters:
> In life every sincere effort leads to human evolution, and it is the same in art.
> Rightly seen, there remains *a single path of evolution* that, regardless of time, *is identical for life and for art.*
(p. 249)

- **Diversity**
- **Purified Forms**
- A person's superficial qualitiesÂ veils the content of their personality.
Demographics in particular can lead to erroneous expectations: assuming a person will like something or act a certain
way because they are female, old, black or asian or jewish or whatever, can lead to mistakes.
> By using subject matter or even particular form alone, figurative art always shows a descriptive,
> literary side that veils the purely plastic expression of line, color, and relationships.

- **Opposites and the Importance of Equilibrium**
- **Purified Forms**
- **Equivalent Mutual Relationships**
- Equilibrium - not quite "harmony" - He addresses this specifically; look it up in the book!  It's around this place, p.252.
Mutual Respect: I believe he is talking about this when he talks about equilibrated relationships.
For me, it is easier for me to define what equilibrium is *not* - for example, the images in
my experimental "Mondrianesque" gallery - than to define what it *is.*
The increasingly wide gap between rich and poor certainly belies a huge amount of disequilibrium.
Disequilibrium is likewise apparent in the entire range of abusive relationships, from mansplaining to spousal murder.
I suppose it is a sad fact of either my pessimistic outlook on life - or simply life itself - that I cannot
think of a good example of equilibrium outside of Mondrian's paintings, of course.
> However, even in the new aesthetic, the word "equilibrium" has caused many misunderstandings and repeated errors.
> The only way to correct them will be by attentive study of the plastic expression of the new art.
> It will be seen that the equilibrium in the new art is not a static state without action, as is generally thought but,
> on the contrary, *a continuous and mutually annihilating opposition of equivalent but unequal elements.*
(p. 252)

- **Team Building**
- **Purified Forms**
- I believe that at minimum a team must have at least two people: at least one who is more pragmatic and comfortable with
physical aspects (xSxx) and one who is more idealistic and comfortable with spiritual aspects (xNxx).
> *The physical aspect of man, of life, diminishes in opposition to the spiritual aspect, which becomes stronger.*

- A team can approach equilibrium by having members whose personalities compliment one another.
Having spiritual portraits of the team members makes it easy to see where their strengths lie and
what type of person could help add diversity and achieve equilibrium.
> It is therefore of great importance for humanity that art manifest in an exact way the constant but varying
> rhythm of opposition of the two principal aspects of all life.
> The rhythm of the straight line in rectangular opposition indicates
> *the need for equivalence* of these two aspects in life: *the equal value of the material and spiritual,
> the masculine and feminine, the collective and individual, etc.*
> Just as the vertical line differes in character from the horizontal, so in life the two aspects have their inherent and opposed character.
> But just as in art these lines have different dimensions, so individuals and their groups differ in strength or size.
> *Art demonstrates that life, through equivalence of its opposed aspects - despite their different nature - can approach real equilibrium.*

- For equilibrium to prevail, it is essential that these relationships be mutually beneficial.
I can see how the internet allows for each of us to specialize and find our brand - allowing each of us to
live "in *independent existence consistent with his own character.*"
Certainly the trend toward freelancing and the gig economy supports a trend toward mutual relationships.
Unlike the full-time marketplace, temporary work supports quickly moving on from abusive managers
without any risk of the stigma that can come from being a "job hopper."
Additionally, the global marketplace gives people and companies alike the opportunity to specialize in a niche, and
thus do the type of work that they enjoy the most, or are the best at, or that pays the most, etc.
> Art demonstrates that the true realization of real life requires *individual liberty.*
> The new life will attain this liberty materially and spiritually.
> Although joined to others by mutual equivalent relationships, the individual will be no less free,
> because of the equivalence of these relationships.
>
> The new art gives *independent existence* to line and color in that they are *neither oppressed nor deformed by particular form,* but
> establish their own limitations *appropriate to their nature.*
> Likewise, in future life society will allow each individual in *independent existence consistent with his own character.*

- **Progress**
- **Liberty**
- If nothing else, the internet obviously offers all of us total freedom of expression.
Also obviously, the ability to exercise this freedom without abusing it will require some work.
> Art in its end shows that individual liberty - until now an "ideal" - will become reality in the distant future.
> This requires a stage of evolution in which man will no longer abuse his liberty.

- Oppositions other than the natural action of breathing in and out exist in the daily lives of everyone.
Significantly, the psychological oppositions of judging and perceiving, thinking and feeling, etc. that Jung identified
in his General Description of the Types are prime examples!
> By following the rhythm of the two contrary oppositions of the straight line, we can say
> that the real life basic to man is simply the action of equilibrated opposition - for example,
> the double movement of respiration, which is contrary and complementary.
> It is a pure expression of vital rhythm....

- Too few people are aware of the true significance of Jung's pairs of psychological opposites.
Is there anyone else on the planet who can see the value of working towards equivalence of these fundamental oppositions?
**This is the core of what I am working to express in the SeeOurMinds.com site: the desire to live a "truly human life."**
The internet should help me find them!
> When we understand the equivalence of contrary oppositions of art's rhythm, we work more consciously to build truly human life.
> For least attention is given to establishing equilibrium through *equivalence of the two fundamental oppositions.*

> With regard to limiting forms, it is not only conventional forms that constitute obstacles to the new life,
> but so do most of the new forms arising in political, social, and economic areas.
> For instance, aristocratic limitations are re-created under democratic forms, and "socialism" often proves

> And with regard to equivalence, we can say that modern man, although cultivated and refined,

- Liberals see conservatives as "evil" because - in general - conservatives are against the good that liberals perceive as
being inherent in the creation of "new ways" of dealing with the changes we experience,
because change is the only constant in life.
Conservatives, on the other hand, see liberals as "evil" because - in general - liberals are working to abolish
the good that conservaties perceive as being inherent in the "old ways" that conservatives seek to maintain,
because they have obviously worked in the past, else we wouldn't be here.

When we die, what is gone?  What remains here on earth?  Who are we, really?
