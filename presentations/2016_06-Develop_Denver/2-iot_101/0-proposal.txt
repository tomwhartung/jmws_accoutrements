Learn about programming the easily-wearable, postage-stamp sized Intel Edison in Arduino (C/C++), JavaScript (Node.js), and Python.

This language-agnostic presentation showcases a set of programs that demonstrate how to achieve basic IoT functionality on the Intel Edison.

It starts with the basics, covering Digital Output, Digital Input, Analog Input, and Analog Output via Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).

It then covers some more advanced topics, including inter integrated circuits (I2C) and using the Edison as a web server.

As the power of hardware grows exponentially and the size of chips and peripherals shrink, forecasters are predicting strong growth for the IoT marketplace.

Now is the time to start familiarizing yourself with this landscape and begin thinking about what role you want to play in it.
