Mom's Story
-----------
My Mom got her undergraduate degree from <a href='https://wp.stolaf.edu/' title='St. Olaf College home page' target='_blank'>St. Olaf College</a>.
She met my father and they married in the early 1950s.

After their marriage ended, she worked her way through Graduate School and got a Master's degree in Psychiatric Nursing.
She then started working at <a href='https://bonsecours.com/richmond/find-a-facility/st-marys-hospital' title='St. Mary's Hospital home page' target='_blank'>St. Mary's Hospital</a> as a psychiatric nurse.

My parents' divorce was very acrimonious.
I wonder sometimes whether the divorce may have had something to do with their personality types being so similar?
Certainly there were many factors at work with all this; moreover, it's best to try to just move on.

My Mom remarried, and I was able to get my step-dad to take the quiz.  He turned out to be an ESTJ.

She and my step-dad were much happier together.  Based on this, am tempted toan theorize that relationships work better when there's only one idealist (i.e., i<q>N</q>tuitive type).

When I told her Dad came out as Extraverted, she laughed and exclaimed, "Your father is NOT Extraverted!"
I can only surmise that they had communication problems.

She died in December of 2000.
I have always felt it was good that she did not witness 9/11, because those sorts of things always affected her greatly.
She could be quite emotional at times.

I am glad to have this image to remember her by!


Dad's Story

My Dad got his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill <a href='https://www.unc.edu/' title='Home page of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill' target='_blank'>(UNC)</a>.
He met my mother and they married in the early 1950s.

He first worked at <a href='http://www.texaco.com/' title='Home page of texaco.com' target='_blank'>Texaco</a> and then at <a href='http://www.altria.com/our-companies/philipmorrisusa/Pages/default.aspx' title='Home page of Phillip Morris' target='_blank'>Phillip Morris</a> as a research chemist.

Their divorce was very acrimonious.

My Dad remarried, but my step-mom refused to take the quiz.  I suspect she was an ESTJ or an ESFJ.

He and I have fallen out of touch over the years.

My Story
--------
Growing up in Richmond, VA in the 1960s meant watching assassinations, riots and a war on TV, and listening to The Beatles.
We could drink 3.2 beer on our 18th birthday, whoo-hoo!

With that teenage feeling of immortality combined with the impending doom of the Cold War hanging over our heads, it was a good time to smoke cigarettes.  In Richmond in those days, they were 25 cents a pack.  There were friends, beer and The Grateful Dead, and work and school.

I worked my way through school, sometimes at part-time jobs, and sometimes at full-time jobs.
During this time, I had full-time jobs at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Overnite-Transportation/163666416984656' title='Facebook page for Overnite Transportation' target='_blank'>Overnite Transportation</a>, <a href='http://www.richmondgov.com/' title='Home page of The City of Richmond VA' target='_blank'>The City of Richmond VA</a>, and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Virginia' title='Wikipedia page for The Bank of Virginia' target='_blank'>The Bank of Virginia</a>.

I got my B.S. in Math (Computer Science) and a Masters of Interdisciplinary Studies from Virginia Commonwealth University
<a href='https://www.vcu.edu/' title='Home page of Virginia Commonwealth University' target='_blank'>(VCU)</a>.

My parents' divorce was very acrimonious.
I wonder sometimes whether the divorce may have had something to do with their personality types being so similar?
Certainly there were many factors at work with all this; moreover, it's best to try to just move on.

My Dad offered to help me with school, and I accepted it for my first year or so.  But the crap that went on wtih their divorce and the aftermath was the main reason I wanted to work my way through school.

My idealism may have also played a factor in this decision.  I just wanted to be done with the whole mess.

It wound up taking me 17 years to finish the Masters Degree, but I had changed my major a few times and quit for four years.
After getting my B.S. in Math, I had to take <em>a lot</em> of additional courses in Art just to get accepted into the prestigious &mdash; at that time &mdash; Interdisciplinary program.  (VCU no longer offers that degree!)
Fortunately I love learning about Art and especially Art History!

Moreover I did it <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDyb_alTkMQ' title='Official video of Sid Vicious doing My Way on youtube.com' target='_blank'>My Way,</a> and I have no regrets!
And although I spent much of the time working, I loved going to school &mdash; and continue to love learning to this day!

<h3>Lesson Learned From Quitting the Ciggies</h3>

Tobacco is a great drug!
When you're down it can make you feel better.
When you're tense it can calm you down.
Too bad it is deadly!

When I quit smoking in 2002 I learned that I'd been self-medicating with tobacco &mdash; using it to repress my anger when people'd insult me.
People would say something rude, I'd go smoke, and feel better.  Free speech, <q>sticks and stones,</q> and all that, right?

When I no longer had that crutch, that place to go to, I had to face this anger.
And I decided I am not going to kill myself just to be nice to assholes.

Unfortunately, some of my <q>friends</q> from those days don't get that, and have insisted on being condescending, manipulative, rude, and flat out insulting.
I've found that ....
More than one of these old <q>friends</q> can no longer lay claim to that title.

If people aren't going to respect you, sometimes <q>better relationships</q> means <q>no relationship.</q>
