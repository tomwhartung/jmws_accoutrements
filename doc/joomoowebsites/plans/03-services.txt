 Target Market and Services to Offer
=====================================
Ideas that have been rolling around in my head for the past few weeks/months/years even

Targeting – Initial Offerings
-----------------------------
o (Early stage) Startups
  Seems like early stage startups are more likely to be able to use generalists
  "First consultation free"
o Small businesses
  "Small projects for small businesses"

Services - Initial Offerings
----------------------------
Currently feel qualified to offer:
o General free-lancing: LAMP, PHP, Linux, CMSes, Java, Python
  No project too small (smaller projects preferred)
→ Need freelancing tips – specific steps and techniques, please!
o De-mystify technology and jargon
o CMS selection
o Training
o Documentation

Services - Possible Future Offerings – Broad Market
---------------------------------------------------
Maybe apply for business loan for initial funding for some of these?
o Device Detection in LAMP CMSes (e.g., targeting ads) – work already done!
o Device Detection in other stacks (MEAN, Java, Python) – would love to do this!
o GROJA/seeourminds.com
  Upgrade site
  Monetization: everyone wants to hook up
  o Articles on site explaining this (end users)
  o Whitepaper/ebook to describe background and lend authenticity (investors)
  Watch app
  IoT component - neopixels
o Simple watch apps (e.g., background)
  Think this would be easy, but
  Would need some sort of loan to buy watch(es?)
o Research IoT Ideas
o Forecast need: galvanize(-type) IoT instructor
  How would one qualify for this?
  Surely an advanced degree and mucho experience are needed (check!)

Questions
---------
Q.1. Do any of these seem feasible?
Q.2. How to prioritize?
Q.3. Will it turn people off if I offer too many services?
    A generalist who is willing to do short projects of most any nature:
    - this seems to me like it could be a thing I could do, and enjoy doing.
Q.4. How to pursue freelancing?
Q.5. How to update web presence?
