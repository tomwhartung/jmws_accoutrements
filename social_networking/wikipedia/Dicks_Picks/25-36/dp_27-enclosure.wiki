==Enclosure==

Included in the release is a single sheet of paper, printed on both sides and folded into thirds, yielding a six-page enclosure.  The front duplicates the disc's cover, and the back is a mostly blank, textured grey that matches the background of the front.

The first page inside lists the contents of and credits for the release.  The next two pages inside contain a large color photo of the band on stage along with copyright information.  The fourth inside page features some fan art that adorns the front and back of an envelope sent to "Grateful Dead ticket sales - Oakland", along with two tickets for the show.  The background of all of these pages is the same textured grey that appears on the cover.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 27, &copy; 1992/2003.</ref>
