 Use Cases
-----------

1. New site from scratch, want to use minimal CSS/Media Queries

2. Existing responsive site, want to put some specific finishing touches on it

3. If you are designing a new site or template, and find yourself with a lot of media queries and more than 1,000-2,000 lines of CSS, maybe it is time to consider ...


I just like the idea of being able to keep most of the site the same, while tweaking bits and pieces of it for specific devices.
