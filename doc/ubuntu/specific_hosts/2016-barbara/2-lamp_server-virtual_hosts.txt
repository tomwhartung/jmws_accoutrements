 Get LAMP Sites Running
========================
LAMP as in LAM-PHP.  We do Python separately.

Ensure Required LAMP Packages Are Installed
-------------------------------------------
Many if not most or all of these LAMP packages have been already installed
[ ] Install as necessary, and ensure the installed versions of these packages match on:
    [ ] ava
    [ ] barbara
    [ ] jane
    Commands (as root):
      dpkg-query -l 'package_name_or_regex'   ## if it's not found, it needs to be installed
      apt-get install -s package_name         ## Simulate installation
      apt-get install -y package_name         ## Do it without requesting confirmation
    Install apache2, apache2-utils, apache2-dev (needed for wsgi)
    Install libapache2-mod-php7.0
    Install php7.0, php7.0-gd, php7.0-mysql, php7.0-mcrypt
    Install mysql-server

Configure Apache
----------------
[ ] Add and update config files in /etc/apache2/sites-available as appropriate
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l *.conf   ## "Installed version"
    For best results, copy conf files from another host and check in to RCS
    Fix ServerAlias specifications in apache2/sites-available/*.conf files
    As root:
      ci -l *.conf   ## "Copied from host xxxxx and updated for this host"
[ ] Config files in /etc/apache2/sites-avaialble
->  For 16.04, copy conf files from jane or barbara:
    Already vetted currently used versions against the new 000-default.conf for 16.04, no changes needed!
[ ] Enable mod_rewrite and php7.0, and start apache2 (as root):
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2
      ls -al mods-*/rewrite*
      ls -al mods-*/php7.0*
      ls -al mods-*/mpm*
    If not enabled (or disabled, as in the case of mpm_event),
      run one or more of these commands as appropriate:
[ ] Enable mod_rewrite and php7.0, and start apache2 (as root):
    As root:
      a2enmod rewrite
      a2enmod php7.0
      a2dismod mpm_event
      a2enmod mpm_prefork
[ ] Check that we have not yet enabled any sites:
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2
      ls -al l sites*/*.conf
    Only the sites-available/000-default.conf file should be linked to
      the sites-enabled directory
    cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
    ln -s ../sites-available/0[1-9]*.conf .
[ ] Put our standard, behind-the-firewall version of index.html file in /var/www
    As tomh on bette:
      cd /var/www/
      toJane index.html
[ ] Restart apache and test in browser, to ensure we are good to go.
    As root:
      service apache2 stop
      service apache2 start
    Access in browser:
      http://localhost
    Should see our standard, behind-the-firewall version of index.html

Populate /var/www
-----------------
[ ] Get all websites' source files in /var/www
    Copy all of /var/www from an existing host or,
       for a painfully detailed process, see this section
       in ../2016-jane-2/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt or
          ../2016-ava/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt
[ ] Fix ServerAlias specifications in apache2/sites-available/*.conf files
    For barbara change "jane" to "barbara" in conf files
    service apache2 start
    Disk Space Spotcheck: /: 4.2G/13G (35%); /home: 0.5G/9G (6%); and /var/www: 5.6G/10G (59%)

[ ] Disk Space Spotcheck:
      /: 4.2G/13G (35%)
      /home: 0.5G/9G (6%)
      /var/www: 5.6G/10G (59%)

Populate databases
------------------
[ ] Databases used on barbara:
    groja.com & seeourminds.com:
      try using current db from lauren:
        seeourminds.com-2016_07_16-lauren.sql.gz
      try using current db from bette:
        seeourminds.com-2016_07_16-bette.sql.gz
    joomoowebsites.com: using db from bette (version 3.5.1)
        joomoowebsites.com-2016_07_16-bette-02-mobile_detect.sql.gz
    tomhartung.com: using db from bette
        tomwhartung.com-2016_07_16-bette.sql.gz

Getting All Sites to Work
-------------------------
For details about this process, see the corresponding sections in
    ../2016-jane-2/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt or
    ../2016-ava/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt
[ ] Ensure Static Sites Work
    artsyvisions.com
    groja.com
    tomh.info
[ ] Ensure LAMP CMS Sites Work
    tomwhartung.com
    joomoowebsites.com
    tomhartung.com

Additional Joomla Caveat
------------------------
For details about this process, see the corresponding sections in
    ../2016-jane-2/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt or
    ../2016-ava/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt
[ ] For joomla on a fresh install of 16.04, install simplexml:
    Check for it in phpinfo.php
       sudo apt-get install php7.0-simplexml
       sudo service apache2 restart
    Reference: http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?t=916040

Install Drush Using apt-get
---------------------------
Tried installing this a couple of ways on jane, using composer, based on up-to-date info on docs.drush.org
Unfortunately that process did not work.
For details about steps taken on jane, and why I suspect those steps failed, see
    ../2016-jane-2/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt or
    ../2016-ava/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt
[ ] Using apt-get:
    As tomh:
      sudo apt-get install drush
      which drush      ## /usr/bin/drush
      drush --version  ## drush version 5.10.0
[ ] Update: This version of drush does not work with Drupal 8
    For now:
      -> Use the version we installed on jane
      -> Hope that because we keep the source on github, we will not need to use it on barbara and ava
    Stay tuned for more updates

Checking the Sites:
-------------------
Checking all sites, in conjunction with getting them to work on jane and ava:
[ ] Checking the static sites:
    [ ] artsyvisions.com
    [ ] tomh.info
[ ] Checking the WordPress site:
    [ ] tomwhartung.com
[ ] Checking the Joomla site:
    [ ] joomoowebsites.com
[ ] Checking the Drupal site:
    [ ] tomhartung.com

Ensure Resume is Online
-----------------------
**************************************************
*** We forgot this last time, and that is BAD. ***
******************************************************
*** My resume references this site so it NEEDS TO WORK! ***
***********************************************************

[ ] Install Mobile-Detect
As tomh:
  gor                    # /var/www/subsites/resume
  cd ../idMyGadget/gadget_detectors/mobile_detect/
  git clone git@github.com:serbanghita/Mobile-Detect.git


[ ] Create links needed to enable resume
As tomh:
  gor                    # /var/www/subsites/resume
  ln -s ../idMyGadget .
  cd js
  ln -s ProfessionalExperience-tomwhartung.js ProfessionalExperience.js
  ln -s Resume-tomwhartung.js Resume.js

Test in browser:
  http://barbara.tomwhartung.com/resume/

Ensure Default Site Is Disabled
-------------------------------
Remove the link to sites-available/000-default.conf in the sites-enabled directory

As tomh:
  cd /etc/apache2
  l sites-available
  l sites-enabled
  sudo rm sites-enabled/000-default.conf
  l sites-enabled

Double-check to ensure only the live sites are enabled!

Ensure this link takes visitors to someplace harmless (e.g. artsyvisions):
- http://barbara:80


Back It All Up
--------------
[ ] Ensure we have backups of everything, including a copy for off-site
[ ] Set up (semi-)automatic backups as appropriate

[ ] Disk Space Spotcheck:
    /:        4.6G/13G (40%)
    /home:    1.3G/9.1G (15%)
    /var/www: 6.2G/10G (66%)

Final Steps
-----------
[ ] Update apache logs config so we can tell which site each message applies to
    Reference:
      https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-logging-and-log-rotation-in-apache-on-an-ubuntu-vps
    Update all files in /etc/apache2/sites-available
    Change:
      CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
    to
      CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log vhost_combined
    and restart apache2:
      sudo service apache2 restart
[ ] Use logrotate to rotate apache logs weekly
    Reference:
      https://serversforhackers.com/managing-logs-with-logrotate
    Ensure logrotate is installed:
      sudo dpkg-query --list '*rotate*'
    Check installed version of the logrotate conf file for apache into RCS
    As root:
      cd /etc/logrotate.d
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l apache2    ## "Installed version"
    Edit the config file as desired
      sudo vi /etc/logrotate.d/apache2
    This time we are changing it to rotate them weekly and keep a year's worth:
      "daily" -> "weekly"
      "rotate 14" -> "rotate 52"
    and adding these lines to use dates for the log file name extensions (instead of .1, .2, etc.):
      dateext
      dateformat -%Y-%m-%d-%s
