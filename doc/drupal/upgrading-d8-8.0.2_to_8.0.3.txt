Development Host (currently bette):
----------------------------------
Upgrading 8.0.2 to 8.0.3 on 2016_02_05:
1. Download the tgz file and unpack it.
   Download tgz file from:
      https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal
   Unpack into:
      /var/www/tomhartung.com/htdocs/drupal-8.0.3
2. Ensure current site code matches github repo
   gotht
   git pull
   git status
   # Ensure the code currently being used matches what's in the repo
   ga; gc 'Latest updates yadda yadda yadda.'; gpom   # as necessary
3. Clear the cache, backup the DB, and put the site into maintenance mode
3a NOTE: if actively developing new extensions, first restore DB to latest
   version that has no installed extensions,
   gobu
   ls -altr
   ### Restore DB to early version
   ### OR optionally disable all custom extensions: https://www.drupal.org/node/1494290
   ### rs -d YYY_MM_DD d8 0X-no_custom_extensions
   ### Be sure to re-enable caching first!
   gothh
   cd gitignored/sites/default
   cp settings.local.php-caching_enabled settings.local.php
   rs -d 2016_01_09 d8 04-no_custom_extensions-after_upgrading_to_8.0.2
   ### Verify no custom themes installed: Admin -> Appearance
   ### Verify no custom modules installed: Admin -> Extend
3b Clear cache, etc.
   gotht
   drush cr   # Also (if paranoid) Admin -> Configuration -> Performance -> Clear All Caches ("why not?")
   bu d8 01-before_upgrade_to-8.0.2
   Admin -> Configuration -> Development -> Maintenance Mode
4. Update new release tree with the .git dir and my customizations
   gothh
   cd tomhartung.com-d8.0.3
   cp -rp ../tomhartung.com-d8.0.2/.git .
   cp -p ../tomhartung.com-d8.0.2/.gitignore  .
   cp ../tomhartung.com-d8.0.2/README.md .
   # Currently we have some third party modules (for migration) plus my jmws one
   cd modules
   cp -rp ../../tomhartung.com-d8.0.2/modules/*   .
   # Currently we do not have any third party themes so just copy over the links to my jmws ones
   cd ../themes
   cp -rp ../../tomhartung.com-d8.0.2/themes/jmws   .
   # Make sure we didn't add something then forget about it, etc.
   cd ..
   gs | grep deleted
5. Check for changes to default.services.yml and default.settings.php
   ### See https://www.drupal.org/node/1494290#comment-9488185
   gothh
   diff tomhartung.com-d8.0.2/sites/default/default.services.yml tomhartung.com-d8.0.3/sites/default/default.services.yml
   diff tomhartung.com-d8.0.2/sites/default/default.settings.php  tomhartung.com-d8.0.3/sites/default/default.settings.php
   ### See what changes have been made (that I need to migrate) along with my secret db info and other customizations:
   ### Migrate these changes into the copies of these files that we are using as necessary
   ### Note that the copies of these files that we are using are under htdocs/gitignored/sites/default
6. Update new release tree with links to my gitignored files
   gothh
   cd tomhartung.com-d8.0.3
   cd sites/default
   # *** Optionally *** double-check for changes if you like!  Paranoia will destroy ya!!
   diff ../../../gitignored/sites/default/default.services.yml default.services.yml
   diff ../../../gitignored/sites/default/default.settings.php default.settings.php
   # *** End optional commands ***
   rm default.se*
   ln -s ../../../gitignored/sites/default/*.* .
   ln -s ../../../gitignored/sites/default/files .
7. Switch the link and run lnSubsites.py
   gothh
   rm tomhartung.com ; ln -s tomhartung.com-d8.0.3 tomhartung.com
   l   # check link to main site
   lnSubsites.py
   l tomhartung.com/   # check links
8. Visit site to upgrade db as necessary:
   http://bette.tomhartung.com/update.php
   http://jane.tomhartung.com/update.php
   ##
   ## Note: there were two DB updates upgrading from 8.0.2 to 8.0.3
   ##
  -> Test!!
9. If the site looks OK, commit code and backup db:
9.1. Commit and push code:
   gothd
   git status
   ga --all
   gc 'Upgraded to the new release, 8.0.3 .' ; gpom
   gs
9.2. Remove from maintenance mode and backup DB:
   As admin -> Configuration -> "Go online."
   bu th 02-no_extensions_installed-upgraded_to_8.0.3
   tarHome

Backup Host:
------------
[ ] jane

Currently these are the goals and concerns:
o  Use already-upgraded copy of db from bette (no extensions installed)
o  Use already-upgraded copy of code from bette (github)
o  Test with idmygadget_bartik
o  Test disabling cache

Process:
1. Grab updated code base (leaving old base for backup)
2. Clear cache (drush and admin)
3. Restore DB used on jane (no custom extensions installed)
4. Link customizations to new code
5. Link gitignored and subsites to new code

Commands:
1. Grab new code base
   gothh
   mkdir fresh_clone.tmp
   cd fresh_clone.tmp
   git clone git@github.com:tomwhartung/tomhartung.com-d8.git
   mv tomhartung.com-d8 tomhartung.com-d8.0.2
   cd ..
   mv fresh_clone.tmp/tomhartung.com-d8.0.2 .
2. Clear cache
   gotht
   drush cr   # also do Admin -> Configuration -> Performance -> Clear all caches
3. Restore DB
   rs -d 2016_01_09 -h jane d8 04-no_custom_extensions-after_upgrading_to_8.0.2
   rm tomhartung.com; ln -s tomhartung.com-d8.0.2 tomhartung.com ; l
4. Link customizations
   gotht
   # Currently we have some third party modules (for migration) plus my jmws one
   cd modules
   cp -rp ../../tomhartung.com-d8.0.1/modules/*   .
   # Currently we do not have any third party themes so just copy over the links to my jmws ones
   cd ../themes
   cp -rp ../../tomhartung.com-d8.0.1/themes/jmws   .
5. Link gitignored files and subsites
   cd ../sites/default
   ln -s ../../../gitignored/sites/default/*.* .
   ln -s ../../../gitignored/sites/default/files .
   lnSubsites.py
6. Test!

Production Host:
----------------
[ ] lauren - only when the others are done and all bugs are worked out

Notes:
o  Cache needs to be disabled for device detection to work
o  Last time we had issues with the cache, unable to clear it in back end
   due to whitescreens when trying to access Admin -> Configuration -> Performance
*** Possible solution: clear cache using drush
o  Was able to deply from jane to bette with cache enabled 
o  8.0.1 DB should be compatible with 8.0.2 code but we need to have a process
   that allows for updating the DB on one host with an updated copy from another.

Standard Plan Prologue (can not have too many copies of the db!):
0. Clear cache on all three sites
   (Both drush and in admin because, paranoia and safety first)
1. Enable caching on all three sites (hosts)
   gothh
   cd gitignored/sites/default
   cp settings.local.php-caching_enabled settings.local.php
2. Clear cache on all three sites
   (Both drush and in admin because, paranoia and safety first)
3. Backup DB on all three sites
4. Take site offline

Plan A (safest and probably best for now):
5. Pull code, core and customizations
6. Run update.php:
   http://tomhartung.com/update.php
7. Test
8. Put online

Plan B (maybe faster and we will want to do something like this when we are adding content):
5. Ensure we have the right versions of the extensions we want running on bette
6. Restore db running on bette on lauren.
7. Test

(Old d7) Overview of Process on backup and production hosts:
o  Pull the new code into the directory that is already being served
   (so we do not have to run any of the ln* scripts)
o  Restore already-updated db from bette to this host
