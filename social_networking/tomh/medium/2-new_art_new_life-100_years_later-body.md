The New Art - The New Life: 100 Years Later

# Body

In 1911, the Dutch painter [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) (1876-1944) moved from The Netherlands to Paris.
He soon began contributing to the
[De Stijl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl) - Dutch for "The Style" - art movement.

Mondrian started out painting representational, "particular" paintings of such things as trees and landscapes.
His paintings gradually became more and more abstract until all representation was "annihilated."

Reduced to only the essential elements, his later work consisted of images
containing black perpendicular lines and rectangles painted in primary colors on a white background.
He called this type of painting "Pure Neo-Plasticism" and the goal of his paintings was to
compose these essential elements so that these opposites of color and form would exist in equilibrium.

It looks easy to create these compositions, but it is not!

## The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships

The evolution in his paintings is interesting, but his writings - which explain his
perceptions and reasons for painting like this, are fascinating.
He claims that just as art has evolved into opposites in equilibrium, so will future society.

He completed his book
[The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Art-Life-Collected-Twentieth-Century/dp/0306805081)
in 1931, but by then had been working on it since at least 1921.
That may not quite be 100 years ago, but it's close enough.

Following is a quote from the book's introduction, written by Mondrian in 1932:

> The culture of art demonstrates that only *man's development* in the distant future can create
> universal equilibrium through the *establishment of equivalent relationships.*
> These relationships are already realized in pure art - art free from figuration and all limiting form - expressing the
> beauty of equivalent relationships exclusively through pure line and color.
> This art is an image of the ideal human goal toward which humanity is moving.

(p. 278)

> Until now the search for universal equilibrium has been neglected in favor of individual interests.
> Art demonstrates that, as long as these dominate, world equilibrium cannot exist.
> To achieve universal equilibrium, the new art had to sacrifice the beauty of limiting and particular form in order to
> establish equivalent relationships through their universal aspect of color and line.
(p. 280)

## The New Art - The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships (1931)

Written over a period of three years, based on ideas developed over the previous decade, but never published during his lifetime.

*Emphasis in original.*

> If art is an expression of life and anticipates it, we can state that the new life is *the culture of equivalent relationships.*
> ....
> Thus in the same way as art, life reaches a state of real equilibrium
> *through pure and equivalent relationships of increasingly free individuals.*
(p. 248)

> [T]he equilibrium in the new art is ... *a continuous and mutually annihilating opposition of equivalent but unequal elements.*
(p. 252)

> *The physical aspect of man, of life, diminishes in opposition to the spiritual aspect, which becomes stronger.*
(p. 254)

> The rhythm of the straight line in rectangular opposition indicates
> *the need for equivalence* of these two aspects in life: *the equal value of the material and spiritual,
> the masculine and feminine, the collective and individual, etc.*
> Just as the vertical line differes in character from the horizontal, so in life the two aspects have their inherent and opposed character.
> But just as in art these lines have different dimensions, so individuals and their groups differ in strength or size.
> *Art demonstrates that life, through equivalence of its opposed aspects - despite tehir different nature - can approach real equilibrium.*
(p. 254)

> Art demonstrates that the true realization of real life requires *individual liberty.*
> ....
> The new art gives *independent existence* to line and color in that they are *neither oppressed nor deformed by particular form,* but
> establish their own limitations *appropriate to their nature.*
> Likewise, in future life society will allow each individual in *independent existence consistent with his own character.*
(p. 255)

> When we understand the equivalence of contrary oppositions of art's rhythm, we work more consciously to build truly human life.
> For least attention is given to establishing equilibrium through *equivalence of the two fundamental oppositions.*
(p. 257)

> If evil is synonymous with abolition and thus with suffering, and
> good is synonymous with creation and thus with joy, then in real life good and evil destroy each other.
(p. 260)

> *[C]oncrete life is our actual human life, and it is logical that we are constrained to givit first attention.*
(p. 263)

> If all men were just and honest, all would be well and universal equilibrium would be spontaneously established.
(p. 265)

> Capitalism as cultivated until now is a limiting form that is abolishing itself and
> will be abolished in the culture of equivalent relationships.
(p. 266)

> A just solution must be found, for all human beings are basically equal and all are entitled to an equivalent existence.
> This is not achieved by charity or love or friendship, for these qualities cannot create pure relationships.
> *The essential value of each individual entitles him to an existence equivalent to that of others;*
> if disabled, he must be supported *in keeping with the value* that he is unable to realize; he is a communal responsibility.
> This is important not only for those who are incapable of contributing equivalent values,
> but also for the others who, being assured of a livelihood, will have the strength to cultivate themselves,
> to live their own lives, that is, to give u p their dependence upon limiting forms.
> The entire community would thus benefit.
(p. 267)

> Just as art itself has slowly created a new plastic expression of more real equilibrium,
> life itself will slowly create this equilibrium in a new social and economic organization.
(p. 269)

> High universal morality finds its expression in the apogee of the culture of equivalent relationships.
> Art in its end demonstrates that only line and color free from all oppression of form can constitute equivalent relationships.
> Thus in life only the free individual and groups of free individuals can form a mutually equivalent organization and
> become capable of realizing the content of high universal morality, which prescibes that we live for each and for all.
(p. 270)

**This sums it up quite nicely:**

> Every day we are astonished by the complete absence of true love, friendship, brotherhood, kindness.
> Centuries and centuries ago the great mesage of universal love was proclaimed: although its influence is undeniable, man has not changed.
> Therefore, let us not insist upon what has shown itself as unrealizable.
> Art demonstrates that *life impels humanity toward equivalence of its two opposed aspects and
> thus toward the destruction of individual limitations.*
> This is how life can realize the high ideals proclaimed so long ago.
(p. 273)
