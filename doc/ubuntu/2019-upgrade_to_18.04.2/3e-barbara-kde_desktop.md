While looking for information about ripping cds, I found this page about installing and using KDE Desktop:
- https://www.configserverfirewall.com/ubuntu-linux/ubuntu-install-kde/

So I thought I might give it a try.

# Installation

Commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install kde-plasma-desktop
```

# Test Drive

Tried the KDE Plasma desktop along with the others:

- KDE Plasma - OK but not what I am used to
- Ubuntu - The default, which is ok but not what I am used to and does not enable me to have the desktops the way I want them
- Ubuntu on Wayland - ok but not what I am used to and does not enable me to have the desktops the way I want them
- Unity - What I am used to, and enables me to have my desktops the way I want them

Switching to Unity, for the desktops, and it's what I am most familiar with.
