=====================================
The process is simple enough, but can be a little tricky 
when we haven't done it in awhile.

Quick keys:
-----------
Cmd-A = Select all
Cmd-1
Cmd-E - Zoom to selection

Process
--------
1. File -> Save As into directory:
     /art/music/analog_projects/Audacity/<Artist>/YYYY-<Album>
2. Record - do not pause when flipping, use that dead space for noise removal
3. Noise Removal:
   Click and drag to select dead space between sides
   Effect -> Noise Removal - take sample
   Cmd-A (select all)
   Effect -> Noise Removal - remove noise
4. Optional: Find Silence
   Cmd-A (select all)
   Analyze -> Silence Finder
5. Split into Tracks
   Use tracks found in step 4. or use Cmd-B to insert them individually
6. File -> Edit Metadata
7. File -> Export Multiple Tracks
   Export into:
     /art/music/mp3-new/<Artist>/YYYY-<Album>
   Check the metadata for each track
8. Tar and copy to a linux host, e.g., bette
     tar -cvzf YYYY-<Album>.tgz YYYY-<Album>
     toBette YYYY-<Album>.tgz
9  Fix file names (remove spaces and special characters) by running:
     fixMusicFileNames
10. Use Easytag to add album artwork and check mp3 ID data

Tips
----
ALWAYS clean the record first - it can't hurt!

Splitting into tracks:
o Silence finder doesn't work very well on live recordings
o It's much easier to use Cmd-B to add track labels
