 Installing Node, NPM, Etc.
============================

This is the process we are running to set up jane.
--------------------------------------------------
It should be perfectly usable on bette and lauren, when we get to that.

[ ] Install nodejs: analysis and commands

    --> On jane: use apt to install the current versions available for 16.04: 4.2.6 and 3.5.2
    As root:
        apt-get install nodejs
        cd /usr/bin
        ls -al node*    # verify we have no executable here named just "node"
        ln -s nodejs node
    Reference for installing using apt-get:

[ ] Install npm
    As root:
        apt-get install npm
        npm set prefix /usr    # needed so it does not install CLIs in /usr/local
[ ] NODE AND NPM INSTALLATION NOTES:
        The installation process that I ran on bette (14.04), using wget:
        o  installed the node executable as /opt/node/bin/node
        o  installed the npm executable as /opt/node/bin/npm
        o  created a link in /usr/local/bin to /opt/node/bin/node
        o  created a link in /usr/local/bin to /opt/node/bin/npm
        --> I DO NOT LIKE THESE LINKS IN MY /usr/local/bin , BECAUSE I MANAGE THAT SEPARATELY!
        --> NEED TO CHANGE THE PREFIX:
        npm set prefix /usr
        The installation process that I ran on jane (16.04), using apt:
        o installed the node executable as nodejs in /usr/bin/nodejs
        o installed the npm  executable as npm    in /usr/bin/npm
        --> This is more like what I would expect - except I cannot run "node" on the command line.
        --> Hence the "ln -s nodejs node" command!
[ ] Node and npm installation - notes for the future:
    --> If we want to use this in production (on 14.04):
    -->    use wget to get that version,
    -->    OR upgrade server to 16.04
    --> In the future, consider using NVM
[ ] Install express
    Ubuntu 14.04 - as root:
        apt-get install node-express
    Ubuntu 16.04 - as root:
        ### npm install express            // do not think this is needed
        npm install -g express-generator   // allows running from command line
        cd /usr/bin
        ln -s /usr/local/lib/node_modules/express-generator/bin/express .
        which express
    All - as tomh:
        which express
