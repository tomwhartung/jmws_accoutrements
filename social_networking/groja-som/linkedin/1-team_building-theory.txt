 Team Building: My Theories
============================

My Assumption
-------------
I believe diversity helps entities be more successful and resilient to change.
This is certainly true when it comes to investing money.

My theory is that diverse teams are more successful and resilient to change than teams that are not diverse.

Types of Diverse Teams
----------------------
Demographic Diversity (External, Visible)
Diversity that is based on demographics is certainly important.
Not only does it intuitively seem more fair, if product is to appeal to a
broad range of demographics, it should be built and sold by people who belong to a
broad range of demographics.

Psychological Diversity (External, Invisible)
My theory is that even the smallest teams need to have members that can cover all
four primary functions (i.e., all four colors) to some extent:
- Blue (i"N"tuiting: learniing and working with ideas)
- Green ("T"hinking: making logical decisions)
- Red ("F"eeling: making emotional decision)
- Yellow ("S"ensing: noticing and working with facts)
Just as a demographically diverse team could more successfully build and sell products to a demographically diverse marketplace,
I believe that a psychologically diverse team could more successfully build and sell products to a psychologically diverse marketplace.

Tech Startups in Particular
Everyone uses a computer.  Hence, the market for technical products is diverse.
Having a well-rounded, diverse team is essential to developing a product that appeals to a diverse set of customers.
