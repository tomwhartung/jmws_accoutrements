Idea for addressing a want, pain, or fear in my first ebook:

- Death: yours and mine
- Grojas: only way to really preserve your personality

Planning to give it away.

- Idea for experiementation:
  - Give book away, sell the image
  - Sell the book for like $1 and have it include a coupon for a free image
  - Logistics?
  - Compare success of ideas?
  - How to have a coupon in an e-book?

This might be silly but think about it.
