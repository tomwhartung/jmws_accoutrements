 Experimenting With Extras
===========================
Making notes on how to install "extra" packages we want to experiment with
so that if we like them we have the instructions readily available for
next time.

Running these commands on bette.
--------------------------------
We should be able to run these on other hosts.

Install the Sublime text editor
-------------------------------
I am happy with vi, and it is pretty much always there, but I want to install
sublime because:

o It was definitely ok when I used it before (but I like vi, so...)
o I would think it has matured and gotten better since the last time I tried it
o This real python class recommends it, and they might know more about it than I do

The process is pretty easy - only one reference needed!

    http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/159094/how-to-install-a-deb-file-by-dpkg-i-or-by-apt

[ ] Download the latest .deb file from:
      http://www.sublimetext.com/
[ ] Move the .deb file to the apt archives dir:
    As tomh:
      cd /var/cache/apt/archives
      sudo mv ~/Downloads/sublime-text_build-3126_amd64.deb .
      l sublime-text_build-3126_amd64.deb 
[ ] Simulate installing it:
    As tomh:
      sudo apt-get -s install ./sublime-text_build-3126_amd64.deb
[ ] Install it for realsies:
    As tomh:
      sudo apt-get install ./sublime-text_build-3126_amd64.deb
[ ] Note:
      The command to run sublime is not "sublime" or "sublime-text" , it's "subl"
[ ] Make sure it's in our path, and make sure we can run it:
    As tomh:
      which subl   ## /usr/bin/subl
      subl

Install Apps for Working With Media
-----------------------------------
[ ] Install SoundConverter (useful for converting wma files to mp3)
    Search for it in the Ubuntu Software app
    Install and lock to launcher
[ ] Install Kdenlive...

Install KVM for Working With VMs
--------------------------------
References:
  Looks to be a bit old but ok nonetheless:
    https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation
  For 16.04 and includes steps to set up bridged networking
    https://linuxconfig.org/simple-virtualization-with-ubuntu-16-04-and-kvm
[ ] Ensure the hardware supports virtualization:
    As tomh:
      egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
    Output must be > 0
      (else use virtualbox or VMware)
[ ] Check for 64-bit OS
      uname -m
    Output should be 'x86_64'
    ('x86_64 is synonymous with amd64.')
