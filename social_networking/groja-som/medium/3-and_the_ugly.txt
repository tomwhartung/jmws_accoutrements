Ugly Content:

I want to help people - myself included - see past the surface.

The Ugly thing is, some people refuse to see past the surface.
They focus on others' superficial qualities, such as gender, age, race, religion, height, weight, etc.

Another Ugly thing is,
 down-to-earth, pragmatic, closed-minded people may find this arrogant.
These pragmatic types outnumber idealists like me 3-to-1 [link to stats].

The Really Ugly thing is,
  some people use superficial traits to create divisions between people and
  even foment hatred between superficially dissimilar groups.
This increases my feeling of urgency.

It follows that some people will undoubtedly feel offended by my desire to see past it.
Even without this anticipated misunderstanding, there seems to be no way to escape the trolls.

The Horror
----------
Moreover, I believe that some people feel the need to insult others and their work to
  subconsciously compensate for some perceived lack in themself, e.g., their inability to see past the surface, and
  perhaps even their failure to think about seeing past it before finding one of my spiritual portraits online.

As an idealist, I try my best to refrain from that sort of senseless behavior, and
  it's a complete waste of my time to try to educate a complete stranger who has no desire to learn.

In other words, some people have no desire to acknowledge the existence of Kandinsky's triangle,
  much less participate in the movement of it toward it's ultimate destination.

Yes people like this do exist.  They have smart phones but no interest in being smart,
being only interested in putting themselves above others in any way they can.

Also: link to Kandinsky article and pull quote about the one man.

Bottom Line:
------------
Only addressing this negativity and hostility once.  Not wasting time on closed-minded dumbasses.

Assuming many people will understand and appreciate this work only after I am dead.

And here is my response: [link to video of Straight to Hell by The Clash, e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX71qQ8EOmc ]

Getting off on Tangents:
------------------------
Down-to-earth, pragmatic, closed-minded people thought the Beatles were arrogant, and burned their albums in the mid-1960s.
And who got the last laugh there (hahaha-hehehe-hohoho [link to I Am the Walrus])?

Ultimately, one way or the other, it's a new spin on an age-old trope: one perceived insult leads to a counter attack,
  soon both parties spiral into a bottomless pit of complete negativity.
