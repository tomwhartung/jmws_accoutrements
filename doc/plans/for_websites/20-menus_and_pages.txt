 Menus and CTA Pages
=====================
Some of the things we want to measure are dependent on site structure.

Some sites already have a fairly solid menu structure, other "new" sites
need to be redone completely.

This text file focuses on the changes that need to be made, and how the
"new" sites will be structured.

--------------
All existing pages will need the GA All Pages tag.
