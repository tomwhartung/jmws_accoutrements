Included with the release is a single sheet of paper folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure.  The front duplicates the cover of the CD and the back contains an oval-shaped, purple-tinted, [[monochrome]] photograph of the band on stage against a background of clouds that merges seamlessly with the clouds on the cover.  The two pages inside contain a wide black-and-white photograph of the entire band on stage along with lists of the contents of and credits for the release.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 9, &copy; 1997.</ref>
