# Core Ideas

Ideas for addressing a want, pain, or fear - which is what Seth Godin suggests - in my first ebook:

- Death: yours and mine
  - You cannot answer the questions when you are dead
- Grojas: only way to really preserve your personality
  - You will never see your personality unless I do it before you die
- Fear: are you afraid of your own subconscious?

Planning to give it away.

- Idea for experiementation:
  - Give book away, sell the image
  - Sell the book for like $1 and have it include a coupon for a free image
  - Logistics?
  - Compare success of ideas?
  - How to have a coupon in an e-book?

This might be silly but think about it.

**Need to focus on content to start!**

It's always nice to bring stuff like this to the surface.
That's all I am doing, is making the invisible visible.
