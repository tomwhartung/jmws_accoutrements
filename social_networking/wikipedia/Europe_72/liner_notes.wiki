===''Europe '72, Vol. 1: Wembley Empire Pool, London, England (4/7/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/7/1972 Gary Lambert sets the scene by writing that "the Dead were overshandowed by ''the'' pop culture story in the U.K. at the time, a fleeing craze known as '[Bolan Mania|https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bolanmania&redirect=no]'".  The author goes on to discuss the "[symbiosis|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis] between the U.S. and U.K rock scenes", and quotes "the great British playwright [Tom Stoppard|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Stoppard]" as saying "Everybody had a sense of that".  Lambert then details how "The first shows were scheduled for April 5-8 at the 3,000-seat [Rainbow Theatre|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Theatre]," then moved to "the Commodore in King Street, Hammersmith, instead of the now closed Rainbow Theatre" and then ultimately "turned into two at the building today known as the [12,000-plus-capacity] [Wembley Arena|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Arena], then called Empire Pool", before closing this contribution with "To be continued on 4/8/72. . ." [elipsis in original].
