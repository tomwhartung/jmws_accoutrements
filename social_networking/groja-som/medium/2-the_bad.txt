 The Bad: Second of Three Articles
===================================
For important background information, see 0-the_good-the_bad-and_the_ugly-overview.txt in this directory.

Theme Song:
-----------
Oh Well by Fleetwood Mac

Theme:
------
I can't assume people will "get it."

Bad Content:
------------
I want to help people - myself included - see past the surface.

The Bad thing is, not everyone gets this.
Understanding these images requires a little bit of "work."

Another Bad thing is, the personality assessment used does not cover everything.
Morality, intelligence, artistic, and athletic ability, none of these show up in these spiritual portraits.
People expecting to see these qualities represented in the images will be disappointed.

And yet another Bad thing is, it takes a long time to create these images.
I spent much of a three-day just on Charles Foster Kane.

People expecting to instantly understand my spiritual portraits will be disappointed.
People expecting to see all of the latest fictional personalities here will be disappointed.

Examples Needed
---------------
Some people will pick up on the patterns - the correlation between the colors and their attitudes - more quickly than others.
Some people will close themselves off to it completely right from the start.

Part of our individuality is that we are all in a different position relative to the Triangle.  [Link to article]

I am working hard to add and publish more examples as time permits.

Watching and drawing a few portraits from a single season of Game of Thrones takes about a week.
(If you skip the commentaries and watch each episode only once or twice, you are missing out.)

Of course, a lot of this time is spent on research - which is enlightening, entertaining, and enjoyable -
but that doesn't mean I can churn these out in a few hours each.

Bottom Line:
------------
Assuming many people will understand and appreciate this work only after I am dead.

If you get it, great, but if you don't, I don't really care.

Getting off on Tangents:
------------------------
I run this site out of my home, and so clearly have marketable skills, but so far I have made zero money from this passion project.
This does not count the years I have spent writing multiple versions of the program, and the years spent
going to a shit ton of meetups trying to figure out the best way to present and hopefully ultimately monetize this idea.
This goal is far from complete, but I feel I'm on the right track, and far more importantly, know where I can get help.
If you'd like to help me keep the site up to date by contributing to my efforts, <a ...>Contact Me!</a>
It has taken me decades to create this site.
