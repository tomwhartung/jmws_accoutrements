==Enclosure==
Included with the release is a single sheet folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure about the size of the CD case.  The front of this enclosure duplicates the cover of the CD and the back contains a black-and-white photograph showing the entire scene: two skeletons on top of the stage, the sound system and lights above the band, the band on stage, and finally, at the bottom of the image, a portion of the crowd watching them.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 5, 1996.</ref>
