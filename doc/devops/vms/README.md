About our use of Virtual Machines.

## VM Setup

For the steps used to set up the VMs on jane and bette, see the files in
subdirectories of the:

- `doc/ubuntu/vms` directory in this repo, i.e.:
- https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_accoutrements/tree/master/doc/ubuntu/vms

## The Initial Idea

At first I was thinking I'd use these VMs to run the old joomla version of groja.com .

## Later Thoughts

Because I have some spare computers (lauren, bette, and veronica) that do not need to run PHP 7.0+,
it's apparent it will be easier and I'll even feel better using those.

I don't know, the VMs are fine, but they somehow make me sad.  Seriously ... seriously silly - but sadly true :-( .

## Normalcy

This will be nice because I can for sure run my normal backup scripts and all.
It will just be easier and more normal, so there!
