 Adding Tools to Make a Development Host
=========================================
Adding artsy stuff, eclipse, netbeans, phpmyadmin - all of the many
standard tools and files that do not belong on a server.

This is the process we are running to set up jane.

It should be perfectly usable on bette and lauren, when we get to that.
