Idea for first ebook:

- Pure marketing, shameless promotion of Grojas

**Planning to give it away.**

- Idea for experimentation:
  - Give book away, sell the image
  - Sell the book for like $1 and have it include a coupon for a free image
  - Logistics?
  - Compare success of ideas?
  - How to have a coupon in an e-book?

This might be silly but think about it.

**Need to focus on content to start - worry about distribution later!**
