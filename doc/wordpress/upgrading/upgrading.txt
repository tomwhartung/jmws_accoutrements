The process seems to change about the time I get used to it and acheive a comfortable level of automation and documentation.
Plus we don't run it often enough to be really confident about it or good at it etc.

Log

[ ] 2016-
[ ] 2016-xx-xx: 4.4.2 to 4.4.x
[ ] 2016-02-11: 4.4.1 to 4.4.2
[ ] 2016-01-15: 4.3.1 to 4.4.1

All Hosts
---------
1. Backup db on all hosts and ensure code matches what is in github:
   [ ] jane
   [ ] bette
   [ ] lauren
   bu tw 01-before_upgrade_4.4.1_to_4.4.2
   gotwt
   git pull
   git status

Getting core update to work from back end:
------------------------------------------
To enable using the back end to update the code rather than downloading it, follow these steps.
We need to do this for at least one host (e.g., jane).
1. Ensure the following line has been added to wp-config.php :
   define('FS_METHOD','direct');     # This is one key
2. Ensure the web server can write the files by making the following changes:
   Change ownership of all files to www-data, create directory wp-content/upgrade
   gotwt
   mkdir wp-content/upgrade
   sudo chown -R www-data:tomh *          # This is another key
   Change perms of wp-content/upgrade and any subdirectories of it to 775
   sudo chmod -R 775 wp-content/upgrade*  # Unsure whether this step is necessary
   ls -al wp-content/upgrade

Update wp core on jane using admin panel:
-----------------------------------------
1. Update in back end:
   Admin -> Dashboard -> Updates
2. Check in browser for each gadget type:
   If it looks OK, proceed, else figure out what went wrong.
3. Change owner of all files back to tomh and change perm of wp-content and all subdirectories of wp-content back to 755
   gotwt
   sudo chown -R tomh:www-data *
   sudo chmod 755 wp-content wp-content/*
   ls -al wp-content/
4. Check the changes into git:
   gotwt
   git status
   git add --all .
   git commit -m 'Upgrading from 4.4.1_to_4.4.2.' ; git push origin master
5. Backup db on this host:
   bu tw 02-after_upgrade_4.4.1_to_4.4.2

Updating wp core on bette:
--------------------------
1. Make sure database is backed up (in previous section "All Hosts: above)
   bu tw 01-before_upgrade_4.4.1_to_4.4.2
2. Open browser windows:
   Admin panel -> Dashboard -> Updates
   One tab per device - ensure each one looks ok
3. Update core code on bette using git pull:
   gotwt
   git pull
4. Test in browser
   Load admin panel
   If there are db updates will see: "Database update required."
      Click "Update Wordpress Database " button: "Your WordPress database has been successfully updated."
      Click "Continue" button: looks like we are good to go!
   Admin panel -> Dashboard -> Updates
   Ensure it is running the new version
5. Test each tab (gadget type) in browser
   If something is wrong,
      Figure it out and fix it
      Consider using the "Alternative Method" when upgrading lauren (to facilitate backing out of the new code)
6. Backup new copy of db
   bu tw 02-after_upgrade_4.4.1_to_4.4.2

Updating wp core on lauren (production!)
----------------------------------------
1. Disable site
   cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
   ls -al
   sudo rm 080-tomwhartung.com.conf 
   ls -al
   sudo service apache2  restart
   ## Load in browser (verify it is down)
2. Update core code and extensions on lauren:
   Extract (git pull) on lauren
   gotwt
   git pull
   gotwc
   gac p    # fun script that pulls code for all customizations
3. Re-enable site (have admin window ready to go)
   cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
   ls -al
   sudo ln -s ../sites-available/080-tomwhartung.com.conf .
   ls -al
   sudo service apache2  restart
4. Test in browser
   If there are db updates will see: "Database update required."
      Click "Update Wordpress Database " button: "Your WordPress database has been successfully updated."
      Click "Continue" button: looks like we are good to go!
   Admin panel -> Dashboard -> Updates
   Ensure it is running the new version
   Load admin panel: "Database update required."
   Click "Update Wordpress Database " button: "Your WordPress database has been successfully updated."
   Click "Continue" button: looks like we are good to go!
5. Test each tab (gadget type) in browser
   If something is wrong, figure it out and fix it
6. Backup new copy of db
   bu tw 02-after_upgrade_4.4.1_to_4.4.2

Alternative Process for Step 2 Above
------------------------------------
This is more work but enables us to keep a copy of the old code on the disk,
which might be helpful in case there is an issue with the new version.
2. ** Alternative process **
   Keep copy of old code, clone fresh version of site, and create links to customizations etc.
   gotwh
   mkdir tmp
   cd tmp
   git clone git@github.com:tomwhartung/tomwhartung.com.git
   l
   mv tomwhartung.com tomwhartung.com-4.4.1
   mv tomwhartung.com-4.4.1 ..
   cd ..
   mv tomwhartung.com tomwhartung.com-4.3.1 ; ln -s tomwhartung.com-4.4.1 tomwhartung.com
   gotwt
   ln -s ../gitignored/wp-config.php .
   ln_wordpress_customizations
   gotwh
   ln_subsites.py

Updating plugins
----------------
[ ] jane:
We are able to update plugins using the admin back end, as long as we
change the owner of the files in the WP installation directory tree.
1. It never hurts to backup the db!
   bu tw 01-before_upgrading_akismet
2. Ensure the following line is in wp-config.php :
   define('FS_METHOD','direct');
3. Change the owner of all files to www-data:
   gotwt
   sudo chown -R www-data *
4. Update in admin back end
   Admin -> Plugins -> "update now" link for the plugin
5. Change the owner of all files back to tomh:
   gotwt
   sudo chown -R tomh *
6. Commit changes and push
   gotwt
   git add --all
   git commit -m 'Upgraded akismet to latest version' ; gpom
7. Never hurts to backup the db!
   bu tw 02-upgraded_akismet_to_latest_version

[ ] bette:
Right now we are just updating akismet, which we are not using, but we
do want to clear the update flag.  The question is, does updating the
plugin affect the database?  To be on the safe side, we must assume it does.
So we will update it in the back end - to make any DB changes needed in the
local DB, then remove those files and pull code to make git happy.
1. It never hurts to backup the dbs!
   jane: bu tw 03-before_changing_urls
   bette: bu tw 01-before_updating_from_jane
2. Change URLS on jane to point to bette:
   jane: Admin -> General Settings
   Change the WordPress Address (URL) to point to bette
   Change the Site Address (URL) to point to bette
3. Backup DB on jane and copy to bette
   jane: gobu
   jane: bu tw 04-changed_urls_to_bette
   toBette tomwhartung.com-2016_03_24-jane-04-changed_urls_to_bette.sql.gz
4. Restore db on jane to version saved before changing the URLs
   jane: rs tw 03-before_changing_urls
5. Restore new db on bette
   bette: gobu
   bette: rs -h jane tw 04-changed_urls_to_bette
6. Backup both dbs so that the most recent copy is readily available
   jane: bu tw 05-restored_to_latest_version
   bette: bu tw 02-updated_to_latest_from_jane

### Old Process (save for possible future reference):
### 1. Ensure the following line is in wp-config.php :
###    define('FS_METHOD','direct');
### 2. Change the owner of all files to www-data:
###    gotwt
###    sudo chown -R www-data *
### 3. Update in admin back end (to get any changes needed to local DB)
###    Admin -> Plugins -> "update now" link for the plugin
### 4. Change the owner of all files back to tomh:
###    gotwt
###    sudo chown -R tomh *
### 5. Remove changes, checkout current version, and pull code
###    gotwt
###    gs
###    cd wp-content/plugins/
###    l akismet/
###    rm -fr akismet/ ; git checkout akismet/ ; gp
###    sum akismet/*   # optionally/for best results compare to version on bette...
###    gotwt
### 6. Never hurts to backup the db!
###    bu tw 03-after_upgrade_akismet_to_3.1.5

[ ] lauren: 
As long as jane works, follow same processs to update lauren.

Updating themes
---------------
Need to update three themes.

[ ] Upgrade all themes on bette:
   bu tw 04-before_upgrade_twentyfifteen
   gotwt
   sudo chown -R www-data *
   ## upgrade twentyfifteen in admin panel
   gs
   gd
   git add --all
   gc 'Upgraded theme twentyfifteen to version 1.4 .'
   bu tw 05-before_upgrade_twentyfourteen
   ## upgrade twentyfourteen in admin panel
   gs
   gd
   git add --all
   gc 'Upgraded theme twentyfourteen to version 1.7 .'
   bu tw 06-before_upgrade_twentythirteen
   ## upgrade twentythirteen in admin panel
   gs
   gd
   git add --all
   gc 'Upgraded theme twentythirteen to version 1.7 .'
   sudo chown -R tomh *
   test
   git push origin master
   bu tw 07-after_upgrade_all_themes

Checking the diffs after installing these on bette, I can see there
are no database changes.  So we just pull the code.  Note however that
you can never have too many backups of the DB!
[ ] Upgrade code on jane using code from upgrade on bette (checked in to git)
   gotwt
   git pull
   test
   bu tw 06-after_upgrade_themes
[ ] Upgrade code on lauren using code from upgrade on bette (checked in to git)
   gotwt
   git pull
   test
   bu tw 06-after_upgrade_themes

TomWHartung.com - WP Upgrading Notes for 2015
---------------------------------------------
Trying to update using the back end administrator's panel...
bette - FTP settings (undoubtedly firewall issues - I don't see how it could work with my setup)
lauren - took a few tries, finally got it to work!  (I hope!)

Getting core update to work from back end on lauren (4.2.3 to 4.3.1):
---------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Backup db on all hosts:
   bu tw 01-before_upgrade_4.2.3_to_4.3.1
1. Changed the following:
o  Changed ownership of all files to www-data
o  Created directory wp-content/upgrade
o  Changed perms of wp-content to 775
   -> Changed back to 755 (see Updating Plugins below)
o  Changed perms of all subdirectories of wp-content to 775
   -> Changed back to 755 (see Updating Plugins below)
2. What finally worked (apparently)
o  Added the following line to wp-config.php :
   define('FS_METHOD','direct');
o  References:
   https://wordpress.org/support/topic/core-or-plugin-update-could-not-create-directory-httpdocs?replies=27
   http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/141063/when-fs-method-direct-is-chosen
o  Based on the second reference it appears the chmoding and chowning were necessary so leaving all that as-is
3. Quick check in browser: Looks OK

Updating wp core on development and backup hosts
------------------------------------------------
1. Checkin to git on lauren and push:
   gotwt
   gs
   ga --all .
   gc 'Updating to 4.3.1' ; gpom
2. Extract (git pull) on dev and bu hosts
   gotwt
   gp
3. Test in browser
   Load admin panel: "Database update required."
   Click "Update Wordpress Database " button: "Your WordPress database has been successfully updated."
   Click "Continue" button: looks like we are good to go!
   Noting that permission changes made above are not reflected on dev and bu hosts
4. Backup new copy of db on all
   bu tw 02-after_upgrade_to_4.3.1

Updating plugins
----------------
Learned that to enable updates via the admin panel (at least for plugins) we just need to:
1. Add the following line to wp-config.php :
   define('FS_METHOD','direct');
2. Run following commands:
   cd /var/www/tomwhartung.com/htdocs/tomwhartung.com
   chown -R www-data *
However, to get git to work again, we need to chown the files back to tomh.

Updating themes
---------------
Need to update three themes.
Let's see if I can get this process down "to a science," based on what we learned above.

Upgrade template on bette:
   bu tw 04-before_upgrade_twentyfifteen
   chown -R www-data
   upgrade in admin panel
   chown -R tomh
   test
   git commit and push
   bu tw 05-after_upgrade_twentyfifteen
   copy db to jane
Upgrade code and db on jane using results from upgrade on bette
   bu tw 04-before_upgrade_twentyfifteen
   git pull
   rs -h bette tw 05-after_upgrade_twentyfifteen
   test
   bu tw 05-after_upgrade_twentyfifteen
Repeat processes for bette and jane for:
   twentyfourteen
   twentythirteen
Upgrade code and db on lauren using final results from upgrade on bette
   bu tw 04-before_upgrade_twentyfifteen
   git pull
   rs -h bette tw 05-after_upgrade_twentyfifteen
   test
   bu tw 05-after_upgrade_twentyfifteen
