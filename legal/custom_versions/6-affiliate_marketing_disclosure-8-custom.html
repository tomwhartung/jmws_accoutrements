<h1>Affiliate Marketing Disclosure</h1>
<p>Effective date: July 19, 2018</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>JooMoo WebSites LLC ("us", "we", or "our") operates the {{ site_name }} website.</p>
<p>We use <em><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_marketing' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for affiliate marketing' target='_blank'>affiliate marketing</a></em> to help defray the costs of creating, providing, and maintaining this website.</p>

<h2>About Affiliate Marketing</h2>
<p>The internet gives us an opportunity to share our opinions about products we like and recommend them to visitors.  To make it easy for visitors to obtain these products, we partner with certain merchants, known as <q><em>affiliates</em>,</q> and use the <q><em>affiliate marketing links</em></q> they provide in our content.</p>
<p><b>When you click on one of these affiliate marketing links, the following happens:</b></p>
<ol>
 <li>Your browser accesses the merchant's site &mdash; most likely in a new window or browser tab</li>
 <li>If your browser is configured to accept cookies, the merchant's site places a referral cookie in your browser</li>
 <li>If you make a purchase from the merchant &mdash; using the same browser on the same device, and before the cookie expires &mdash; the merchant pays us a commission for the referral</li>
 <li>These commissions help us maintain and improve this and our other sites</li>
</ol>
<p>This type of reimbursement for our work in sharing our recommendations is known as <q><em>affiliate marketing,</em></q> and it helps us recoup some of the investment we have made in creating, providing, and maintaining this website.</p>
<h3>A Win-Win-Win Situation</h3>
<p>Note that following an affiliate marketing link then making a purchase <b>does <em>not</em> add anything to the price you pay for the product</b>.</p>
<p>Affiliate marketing is a type of <em><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance-based_advertising' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for performance-based marketing' target='_blank'>performance-based marketing</a></em> that offers a win-win-win situation for everyone involved:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Following the link and accepting the cookie costs you absolutely nothing</li>
 <li>Merchants pay for the referral only if and when they make a sale</li>
 <li>The commissions we earn this way help us continue to provide the site and develop new content for it</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, this is like <q>free money</q> &mdash; in a manner of speaking &#x263A;.</p>
<h2>Disclosures</h2>
<p><b>In an effort to recoup the time and money invested in creating and maintaining this site, some of the content on the website may contain affiliate marketing links.</b></p>
<h3>Merchants and Agencies</h3>
<p>Following is a partial list of the companies with which we have an affiliate marketing relationship:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Amazon &mdash; see the <q>Disclosure for Amazon</q> below</li>
 <li>CJ Affiliate &mdash; an agency that a variety of merchants use</li>
 <li>Dotster &mdash; the company we use for domain registration</li>
 <li>ShareASale &mdash; another agency that a variety of merchants use</li>
</ul>
<p>This is only a partial list.  Affiliate marketing is a dynamic field, and these affiliations are subject to change at anytime.  Although we may lack diligence in keeping this list up-to-date, we make no effort to hide this information.</p>
<h3>Transparency</h3>
<p>To support transparency, whenever possible we put the name of the affiliate (e.g., Amazon) or the agency managing the affiliate relationship (e.g., CJ Affiliate) in the link itself.  Specifically, it could be either in the URL for the link, or the title attribute &mdash; which is visible by hovering over the link &mdash; or both.</p>
<p>If you want to see the specific affiliate or managing agency for a link, we encourage you to hover over the link and look closely at the referenced URL, and any additional information available in the title attribute, before you click or tap on it.</p>
<h3>Disclosure for Amazon</h3>
<p>Amazon in particular requires us to be very specific and state:</p>
<blockquote>
 <q><b>We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</b></q>
</blockquote>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p><b>We recommend <em>only</em> products that we have enjoyed using and believe are worth purchasing</b>.</p>
<p>If you happen to find a negative review of a product on this site, any links provided to the product will be for more information only.</p>
<p>We would <em>never</em> provide affiliate marketing link to a product we <em>don't</em> like, because we would <em>not</em> recommend it to you.</p>
