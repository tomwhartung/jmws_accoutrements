I intend to eventually publish this at: https://medium.com/@tomwhartung .

"Eventually."

# Goal - The Big Picture

To be able to reference this article in a subsequent article about my vision, and then
able to reference *that* article (about my vision) in a *subsequent* article about the
goals and reasons for creating seeourminds.com .

# Ideas

## Songs

I sometimes like to put Easter-eggy-type links to songs in my articles.  It's a thing.

- What's So Funny 'Bout Peace Love and Understanding
- Love Is All You Need
- Love Is All Is Alright (High Universal Morality)

## My Point

I like Mondrian's idealism and want to contribute to the awareness of the need for more
equlibrium and desire for equivalent relationships.

Or something like that.

## My Take

### Ideas I Like:

- Equilibrium in general
- Equivalent mutual relationships in particular
- Purified forms - in art, people, and society
- Learning about and revealing inner traits and energies
- Honesty

### Parallels With Archetypes

- Breaking things down into essential elements (N/S and F/T) so that we can see them
- Removing distracting surface shit

### Obvious but Important

One can't create the same sort art that Mondrian created, for that would not be art.

# The Article

## Title

The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian

## Body - New

### ("Cold" Introduction)

Piet Mondrian completed his final book, *The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships,*
in 1931, but by then had been working on it since at least 1921.
It is short but profound and abstract - so much so that
[The Collected Works of Piet Mondrian,](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Art-Life-Collected-Twentieth-Century/dp/0306805081)
published in 1987, bears the same title.

Mondrian believed that art and life follow similar paths:
> In life every sincere effort leads to human evolution, and it is the same in art.  Rightly seen, there remains *a single path of evolution* that, regardless of time, *is identical for life and for art.*

He also believed the path that art and life follow is one of purification and equilibrium of opposites:
> If art is an expression of life and anticipates it, we can state that the new life is *the culture of equivalent relationships.*  Just as with the plastic means in art, it is evident that for this life our mentality must become more or less purified, not in an old-fashioned puritanical way, but so as to rise above the oppression of limiting, particular forms.  Thus in the same way as art, life reaches a state of real equilibrium *through pure and equivalent relationships of increasingly free individuals.*

How and why did Mondrian develop his distinctive style, and what are the implications of it for us today and in the future?
This article seeks to answer those questions!

### Introducing Piet Mondrian

### The Power of Abstractions

#### Abstractions in Math and Science

Formulas - V = IR (Ohm's law) - describes the flow of electrons in everything electronic, from the 12 volts of direct current in cars, to
the 220 volts of alternating current in heavy appliances like air conditioners, washers and driers, to the
micro electronics in our smart phones and key fobs.

#### Abstractions in Art

Literature, poetry and music - anything with similies and metaphors - All Along the Watchtower ....
Dance - ballet - story abstracted to its essential elements and retold using the movements permitted by the dance.

[Business - organizational chart - (do I want this here, or in a separate section, or maybe just skip it?)]
[Even terms like bread, man, woman, dog, cat are abstractions in that they are only concepts unless they are qualified (e.g., my cat).]

#### Abstractions in Politics

- Countries: Declaration of Independence,
- Political Parties: Statement of Principles
- Manifestos

Assassinations can be "tricky," because they can turn popular leaders into martyrs.
It's much more difficult to kill an idea - an abstraction - than it is to kill a person.

#### Abstractions in Religion

One might say that gods are the ultimate abstractions.

#### BYO Specifics

Abstractions ....

### The Power of Intuition

[Abstracting processes - ideas: installing software, vacuuming, ???]

Subconscious processing - the "aha" we get when driving, mowing the lawn, washing dishes, taking a shower, etc.

### The New Art - The New Life

My main point and where we quote and explain only the best quotes....

### (Possible) Conclusion

This short book was not published during his lifetime.
I believe this is because he was so far ahead of his time.
It is also so abstract that it is difficult to understand - even for me, and I love abstract stuff!

## Body - Old (To Be Deleted)

In 1911, the Dutch painter [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) (1876-1944) moved from The Netherlands to Paris.
He soon began contributing to the
[De Stijl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl) - Dutch for "The Style" - art movement.

Mondrian started out painting representational, "particular" paintings of such things as trees and landscapes.
His paintings gradually became more and more abstract until all representation was "annihilated."

Reduced to only the essential elements, his later work consisted of images
containing black perpendicular lines and rectangles painted in primary colors on a white background.
He called this type of painting "Pure Neo-Plasticism" and the goal of his paintings was to
compose these essential elements so that these opposites of color and form would exist in equilibrium.

It looks easy to create these compositions, but it is not!

I have learned through experience that changing one of his paintings - his Composition With Red, Blue, and Yellow,
for example - even slightly destroys the image’s equilibrium.
For proof, see the gallery of experimental “Mondrianesque Compositions” at seeourminds.com.

The evolution in his paintings is interesting, but his writings - which explain his
perceptions and reasons for painting like this, are fascinating.

## The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships

Mondrian completed his final book
[The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Art-Life-Collected-Twentieth-Century/dp/0306805081)
in 1931, but by then had been working on it since at least 1921.
That may not quite be 100 years ago, but it's close enough.

In this book he claims that just as art has evolved into a composition containing opposites of form and color in equilibrium,
so will future society.
Following is a quote from the book's Introduction, written by Mondrian in 1932:

> The culture of art demonstrates that only *man's development* in the distant future can create universal equilibrium through the *establishment of equivalent relationships.* These relationships are already realized in pure art - art free from figuration and all limiting form - expressing the beauty of equivalent relationships exclusively through pure line and color.  This art is an image of the ideal human goal toward which humanity is moving.

Are we here today any closer to the goal of living in universal equilibrium than Mondrian was 100 years ago?
Join me in taking a look at some more quotes from this book and see if we can answer that question!
