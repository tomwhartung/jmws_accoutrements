 Getting Comfortable
=====================
Install the basic stuff we need to get around and do the other stuff.

This is the process we are running to set up lauren.
----------------------------------------------------
Lauren is our oldest PC and the plan is to use it only for social networking.

    Window Management -> Resize Window -> General tab ->
      Uncheck "Maximize Vertically if screen edge hit."
[ ] Setup pythonLibs in ~ (/home/tomh) and /usr/local/bin
    This is now needed for scripts like up, killEmAll, and upapa
    ** The whole /usr/local/bin setup needs to be re-examined **
    ** npm likes to put stuff there too! **
    We don't need all of these, but it's nice to have a local copy of them anyway

      cd
      mkdir -p iot/customizations
