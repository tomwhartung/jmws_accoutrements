 JooMooWebSites.com - Upgrading Notes for 2016
===============================================
We're always changing this, so this file is mostly to keep track of
what was done the last time or two, in case we find issues, and to
give us a starting point, with appropriate cautions and tips, for
next time.

[ ] 2016-02-13: 3.4.5 to 3.4.8

Before You Start
----------------
0. On ALL hosts: backup DB and ensure code matches what is in github
   bu jm 01-before_upgrading_3.5.0_to_3.6.0
   gojmj
   git status
   git pull
1. Decide which host to do most of the work on:
   jane - moving production to barbara, which is also running Ubuntu 16.04
       Never updated lauren last time
       May not even bother with bette this time...

Fall Back to Tried and True Manual Procedure - 3.4.5 to 3.4.8:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Doing this on jane today.
0. Always backup DB and ensure code matches what is in github ("Before You Start" above)
1. Download zip into /var/www/joomoowebsites.com/downloads and unpack
   gojmh
   mkdir unzip
   cp ../downloads/Joomla_3.4.8-Stable-Full_Package.zip unzip
   cd unzip
   unzip Joomla_3.4.8-Stable-Full_Package.zip
   rm Joomla_3.4.8-Stable-Full_Package.zip
   cd ..
   mv unzip joomoowebsites.com-3.4.8
2. Copy over the images and switch the link
   gojmj
   tar -cvzf images_joomoowebsites.com.tgz images/joomoowebsites.com/
   cd ..
   mv  joomoowebsites.com-3.4.5/images_joomoowebsites.com.tgz joomoowebsites.com-3.4.8
   cd joomoowebsites.com-3.4.8
   l images                        # should be no subdirectory named joomoowebsites.com !
   tar -xvzf images_joomoowebsites.com.tgz
   rm images_joomoowebsites.com.tgz
   l images/joomoowebsites.com/    # should see a few subdirectories now
   rm joomoowebsites.com  # assuming it's a link to 3.4.5!
   ln -s joomoowebsites.com-3.4.8 joomoowebsites.com
3. Update the new directory tree with a copy of the git files, and remove installation directory
   gojmj
   cp -r ../joomoowebsites.com-3.4.5/.git* .   # bwahahah
   rm -fr installation/
   bu j  01-before_upgrade          # IF NOT DONE ALREADY, DO IT NOW
4. Update the new directory tree with a link to the configuration file and link in subsites and customizations
   gojmj
   ln -s ../gitignored/configuration.php .
   lnSubsites
   cd ..
   lnJoomlaCustomizations
   l modules/ templates/    # should see links to my customizations
   l language/en-GB/        # should see links to my customizations
5. Fix Permissions and Test All the Things!
   gojmj
   sudo chown -R www-data:tomh .
   ### Test front end in browser
   ###    e.g., Check articles with images
   ### Test back end in browser,
   ###    e.g., System Information -> System Information (check version) and -> Folder Permissions
6. Commit the changes and push to github
   git status
   git add --all
   gc 'Updated to 3.4.8.' ; git push origin master
7. Backup the DB and we are done!
   bu j  02-after_upgrade

Upgrading backup host:
----------------------
We have a bit of a history of versions on bette, but have just started it on jane.
So rather than start from scratch or something, for shitz and gigglez, this time around,
ran these somewhat unlikely commands to upgrade bette, enabling us to keep the history
and use it for the main procedure, if we want to, next time.
1. Upgrade bette using github, keeping version 3.4.5 around for historical and consistency purposes:
   tar -cvzf joomoowebsites.com-3.4.5.tgz joomoowebsites.com-3.4.5/
   mkdir unpack
   mv joomoowebsites.com-3.4.5.tgz unpack/
   cd unpack/
   tar -xvzf  joomoowebsites.com-3.4.5.tgz
   mv joomoowebsites.com-3.4.5 joomoowebsites.com-3.4.8    # bwahahahah
   rm joomoowebsites.com-3.4.5.tgz
   cd joomoowebsites.com-3.4.8/
   git pull   # get core upgrade changes checked in on jane
   cd ../..
   mv unpack/joomoowebsites.com-3.4.8 .
   l
   rm joomoowebsites.com ; ln -s joomoowebsites.com-3.4.8 joomoowebsites.com ; ls -al
2. Check links and images
   gojmj
   l modules/ templates/           # ensure there are links to my customizations
   l language/en-GB/               # ensure there are links to my customizations
   l images/joomoowebsites.com/    # ensure there are a few subdirectories
3. Fix Permissions and Test All the Things!
   gojmj
   sudo chown -R www-data:tomh .
   ### Test front end in browser
   ###    e.g., Check articles with images
   ### Test back end in browser,
   ###    e.g., System Information -> System Information (check version) and -> Folder Permissions
4. Backup the DB and we are done!
   bu j  02-after_upgrade

Upgrading Production host:
--------------------------
1. Backup DB and pull the code:
   bu j  01-before_upgrade          # IF NOT DONE ALREADY, DO IT NOW
   cd joomoowebsites.com
   git pull
2. Test in browswer
   ### Test front end in browser
   ###    e.g., Check articles with images
   ### Test back end in browser,
   ###    e.g., System Information -> System Information (check version) and -> Folder Permissions
3. Backup DB and we are done:
   bu j  02-after_upgrade
