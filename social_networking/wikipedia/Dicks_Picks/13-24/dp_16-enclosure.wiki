==Enclosure==

Included with the release is a single sheet of paper folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure.  The front duplicates the cover of the CD, and the back features a rectangular color photograph of the band on horseback out in the countryside, riding away from the photographer.  Under this photo is a white stripe across the page above a circular grey outline of a circular [[Steal Your Face|stealie skull]] with the number 16 inside.

The two pages inside the enclosure contain a single wide black-and-white photograph of the band on horseback and facing the photographer.  Above the band members and against a background of trees are lists of the contents of and credits for the release.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 13, &copy; 1969, 2000.</ref>
