## Core Ideas

Ideas for addressing a want, pain, or fear - which is what Seth Godin suggests - in my first ebook:

- Death: yours and mine
  - You cannot answer the questions when you are dead
- Grojas: only way to really preserve your personality
  - You will never see your personality unless I do it before you die
- Fear: are you afraid of your own subconscious?

Not sure where to put these in the outline?

## Unorganized Ideas

Either merge these ideas into one of the major sections below or don't use them

- Key Point: the images reflect the strength of the preferences
  - People with mild preferences are very different from those with strong preferences - and the images reflect that
- Explaining the core pairs of opposites
  - N vs. S - Perceptions
    - As different as night and day
    - The biggest differences between people
  - F vs. T - Motivations
    - Warm vs. Cool
    - The source of most difficulties between people
- Strong preferences:
  - Meyers-Briggs warns repeatedly that a strong supporting function is essential
- Jobs frequently require us to be more logical than emotional
  - E.g., require working with things when someone would prefer to work with people
- Want to disrupt stereotypes based on demographics
- Sick of the voice in my head that categorizes and judges others based on superficial BS

## My Theories

On the fence about including these ideas.

**It may be best to present these ideas in an article on medium.**

### My Theory 1: Projection and Disappointment

My Theory 1: we project who we are on others.

- We tend to look for who we are in others
- In my opinion, we tend to unconsciously project our tendencies preferences onto others
- That is, we expect others to do what we would do - unless there is a reason not to, such as until we get to know someone better
- Unless we have a reason to think otherwise, we tend to assume others have motivations and perceptions that are similar to ours
- When people do not make choices similar to ours, it can lead to communication problems and failed expectations
- This can be frustrating
  - E.g., for children who want to follow in a parent's footsteps, but are unsuited to do so
  - E.g., for marketers who think all people have similar perceptions and motivations

These are all real world consequences caused by people's failure to understand a few simple abstract principles.

### My Theory 2: ST Jobs at Risk of Automation

My Theory 2: Androids and AI Theory

- People who will like these images are more N and F
  - These people naturally seek out work that is less subject to being automated
- If you are more S and T, your occupation, no matter what it is, is at risk of automation
  - It is easy to give a machine sensory input, but difficult or impossible to give it ideas
  - Machines are made to be logical, it is difficult or impossible to give them emotions

Regardless of what type you are, if you are naturally drawn to work that is easily automated, wouldn't you want to know about it?

## Selling Points

- Good to know what sort of work you are best suited for
- Gain insight into recurring people problems
- Wake up - increase awareness of self and others
  - It's always nice to bring unconscious information to the surface
- All of us are expressing these traits in our daily actions
  - Take control - choose self-knowledge over floating through life like flotsam
  - Many of us are already subconsciously processing this information to varying degrees
  - All I am doing is making the invisible visible
- Strong preferences are visible immediately
  - For example: stubbornness and haplessness
- Regardless of what type you are, if you are naturally drawn to work that is easily automated, wouldn't you want to know about it?
  - See "My Theory 2" above



## Major Sections

Go ahead and expand these now if desired, and just paste them into the outline later.

### Beginning

- Prelude/Forward/Introduction
  - Questions:
    - Are you as happy as you could be?
    - Do you really know yourself?
    - Do you go through life without direction, just responding to things, like flotsam?
    - Could your relationships be better?
    - Etc., "as many as possible"
  - **Grojas can help with all of these issues**

### Middle

Do we want How-to information in this marketing document?

Either:
- Include the How-to
- Put the How-to in a separate document, e.g., an infographic
- Describe what the images represent some other way

- How to Draw a Personality
  - Choose what qualities you want to portray
    - For example, Jungian, Big 5, something from the DSM, etc.
  - Find a questionnaire
    - Find an existing questionnaire that is OK to use, or write your own, or both
  - Decide how to represent the qualities
    - For example, what shapes and colors to use for these traits, what types vectors for those traits, etc.
  - Consider writing a program to do the work
    - Writing a program to convert the results to an image is **not** necessary, but it makes it easy to create consistent images
  - Obtain personality profiles and draw them!
    - Get people to answer the questionnaire

  - [TODO: Adapt this into an infographic - **or do portions of it or the whole thing as an infographic** - and post to pinterst]


- Introduce what each of the colors represents
  - Maybe as part of the How-to?


- Are You Someone Who Will Appreciate Their Spiritual Portrait?
  - World's Shortest Personality Quiz - or Something
    - Instant Personality Quiz?
    - Two questions, pick where you are on the continuum
      - Use at least positive, neutral, and negative synonym on each side
      - Use the colors subtlely in the continuum - a gradient with white in the middle might be nice
      - S ------- N - where are you, on a scale of 1-10?
      - T ------- F - where are you, on a scale of 1-10?
    - What your score means:
      - If your score is 10 or more, you will like your spiritual portrait
        - The higher your score, the better chance you will like it
      - If your score is less than 10, a spiritual portrait is not for you
        - The lower your score, the less probability you will like it
   - How it works
     - Personality traits and images of personalities are abstract
       - If you are more N than S,
       - If you are more Blue than Yellow,
       - If you prefer ideas to facts,
       - If you are more comfortable with abstractions than most,
       - Then you will understand the images more easily
     - Personality traits and images of personalities are all about people
       - If you are more F than T,
       - If you are more Red than Green,
       - If you prefer emotions to logic,
       - If you'd rather work with people than things,
       - Then you will understand the images more easily
