 Process Used to Integrate IdMyGadget With WordPress and Drupal
================================================================
Try to keep on track here!

 Goals
-------
Using the completed work with Joomla as an example.

Where possible and plausible, want to supply options as similar as possible
to those offered by the jmws_protostar_tomh_idMyGadget template.

 Repos
-------
WordPress repos:
[ ] jmws_idMyGadget_for_wordpress
[ ] jmws_wp_twentyfifteen_idMyGadget
[ ] jmws_wp_vqsg_ot_idMyGadget

Drupal repos:
[ ] jmws_drupal_bartik_idMyGadget
[ ] jmws_drupal_stark_idMyGadget
[ ] jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal

 Process
---------
1. Create github repositories

2. Populate repos with existing code base
   o Keeping jmws_idMyGadget_for_joomla separate from jmws_idMyGadget_for_wordpress
     and jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal for now -- to be safe.
   o Continuing to maintain entirely separate copies of themes we are updating
     (rather than use child theme feature of underlying CMS) because I am unsure
     exactly what I will need to change -- again, to be safe.

3. Include files: figure out how and where to include the device detector core code.
   (Yeah fyi this is much more difficult than it looks.)

4. Instantiate JmwsIdMyGadget object.

5. Implement error checking:
   o Wp: plugin not installed
   o Wp: plugin not activated
   o Wp: selected 3rd party device detector not installed
   o Drupal: module not installed
   o Drupal: module not activated
   o Drupal: selected 3rd party device detector not installed

6. Allow device-specific settings of:
   o Site Name (check these details for plausibility and refine if necessary!)
     - There is only one Site Name per site, set in the General Options
     - The device-specific setting is whether to show this.
   o Site Title
     - Device-specific values (unlike Site Name)
     - Used in lieu of Site Name if desired
     - Ignore if blank
   o Logo (image, aka banner?)
     - Device-specific values
     - Ignore if blank (no image)
   o Site Description (aka. Tag Line)
     - Device-specific values
     - Ignore if blank
   o Supply html element drop-downs for each?
     - I would rather like to do this, as it makes things very flexible, specifically:
     - Doing this makes it easy to fit varying lengths of text into the
       spaces provided on each device type, without having to change the code

*** Deploy at this point! ***

7. jQuery Mobile Phone Nav
   o Allow for each device type
   o Yes it does not look good on non-mobile devices but we have to admit that
     we do not know what all future people may actually want

8. Hamburger Nav
   o Allow on none, one, or both sides for each device type
   o Follow pattern used on joomla implementation (e.g.m overriding drawn icon
     with image file(s)) as much as possible
