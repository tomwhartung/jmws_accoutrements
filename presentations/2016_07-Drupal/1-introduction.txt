Standard Elevator-type Stuff

First job: 1976, Assembler -> Cobol, wound up doing that for about 10 years

Masters Degree, 1986-89: Interdisciplinary, Computers & Art - Groja/SeeOurMinds.com

Moved to CA for two years and have been here since 1989, in Five Points since 1991.

Proud of my year-long github streak, but like just about everything else online, that can be faked.

Values:
-------
Savings seem to burn a hole in my pocket - I am afraid someone will steal my money somehow.

[Savings eat a hole in my head - a hole that I like to plug with knowledge.]

Ben Franklin once said: Your best investment is to pour your purse into your head, and no one can take it away from you.

[If you can't take what you learn with you when you die, you are definitely not taking anything else either.]
