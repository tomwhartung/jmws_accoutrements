The Good:
---------
I want to help people - myself included - see past the surface.

This is an image of Fox Mulder's personality.  The Blue shows he is open to new ideas and the Red shows he is passionate.

To learn more about how this image represents his personality, see his spiritual portrait at SeeOurMinds.com.

One Good thing is, I have written a program to help me do this.  Taken as a whole, the images this program creates constitute a language that reveals a lot about an individual in a single glance.

Another Good thing is, it's a simple language: it uses primary colors to represent fundamental traits.

And yet another Good thing is, most if not all religions can agree that our bodies are just temporary shells for what makes us us.  I do not wish to favor any one religion over any others, but I like to think our inner qualities are far more important than the external.

Moreover, a person's superficial qualities have little bearing on what they actually do.  And what people do is far more important than how they look.

This Is My Art
--------------
At various times in my life I have studied music, drawing, painting, photography, dance, and film.  If anyone is qualified to say what is art and what is not art, it is me.

These spiritual portraits are art.  They express how I look at people and view our world.  In this respect, they're no different from any other art.

My hope is that ultimately someday these images will help nudge Kandinsky's Triangle upwards.

Bottom Line:
------------
"I don't have to prove, that I am creative!  All my pictures, are confused!  And now I'm going to, take me to you!"

Calling it "art" gives me artistic license.  Publishing more examples will help more people get it, but that takes time, a lot of time.

It's good, but it's not all a bed of roses though.  For more, see the next article in this series.


Going off on Tangents:
----------------------
I love to learn and in addition to learning numerous computer languages
I believe having enough examples will enable Artificially Intelligent programs to get it.
If you want to stay ahead of the machines, I recommend you invest some time understanding the idea behind these images.
