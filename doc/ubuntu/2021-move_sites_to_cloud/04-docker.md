Installed docker using Ubuntu's Discover program.

Discover's entry for docker includes some notes, aka. "Readme" (my term) about Usage and Running Docker as a normal user.

After installing it, found more detailed information on [docker.io](http://docker.io):

- Contains details about the many ways to install it:
  - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
- The preferred way to do this is via the repository:
  - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository
  - **May want to revisit this!**
- Page with details about what is mentioned in Discover's "Readme"
