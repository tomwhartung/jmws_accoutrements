If I want to add affiliate marketing links on my sites and cover my butt, I need to have a disclosure.

## Requirements

- The Affiliate Marketing Disclosure must be general yet specific enough to use on any of my sites.

## Strategy

From https://termsfeed.com/blog/affiliate-disclosure/ :

> You can always create a simple disclosure like the cartoon example from the NomNomPaleo website above that’s easy to place on individual web pages and blog posts, then have it link to a full page disclosure page to provide more information to your users.

Sounds like the foundation of a good strategy to me!

- Write full disclosure, included with the other legal documents under a "Legal" menu item
- Write a short, simple disclosure, to be included at the top of every page that has an affiliate link
  - This short, simple disclosure links to the full disclosure on a separate page
- Have a short, simple superscript string, such as "[$$]" or "[$!?]" , that immediately follows each affiliate link
- Program the superscript string so that
  - I can easily change the characters used if I want to
  - It takes the user to the part of the page with the short, simple disclosure
  - The text of the short, simple disclosure displays when the user hovers the mouse over the short, simple superscript string

## Process

1. Generator at termsfeed.com: wants $4 for an affiliate marketing disclaimer
  - Checking boxes for website and external links
2. Download templates from termsfeed (they include more clauses, including for affiliate marketing)
  - These are all disappointing
3. Try the templates from thesheapproach.com
  - These are good for short, simple disclosures, but not the main one
4. Copy the Privacy Policy, delete all but the few paragraphs about affiliate marketing, and review and revise it as necessary
  - Review all files found while researching this, i.e., `4-affiliate_marketing_disclosure-*.*` , and update it as necessary
