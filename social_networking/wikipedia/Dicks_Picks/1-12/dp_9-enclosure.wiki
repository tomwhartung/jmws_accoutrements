== Enclosure ==
Included with the release is a single sheet folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure that fits snugly inside the CD case. The front of this enclosure duplicates the cover of the CD and the back contains an oval-shaped, purple-tinted, [[monochrome]] photograph of the band on stage against a background of clouds that merges seamlessly with the clouds on the cover.

The two pages inside contain a wide black-and-white photograph of the entire band on stage. Bassist Phil Lesh is on the left, followed by drummer Bill Kreutzmann, guitarist Bob Weir, and drummer Mickey Hart.  Guitarist Jerry Garcia is on the right side of the fold along with keyboardists Vince Welnick and Bruce Hornsby.

Above this photo is a listing of the band's members and credits for the CD on the left side, with a list of the tracks on the CD taking up the remaining three-fourths of this space.  Finally, copyright information for the CD is in fine print on the far right side, under the track listing for the third CD and above the keyboard players' images in the photo.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 9, 1997.</ref>
