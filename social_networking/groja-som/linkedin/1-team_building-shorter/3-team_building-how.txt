Part 3: Team Building Step 1: Assessment
========================================
This step contains the following sub-steps.

(1) To determine whether my theory is accurate, at least one person needs to fill out
    an evaluation form before the process, so that we can determine whether there is an improvement
(2) Each team member answers a questionnaire that yields a four-letter type score
(3) I use the program to draw an image based on the score

Each of these sub-steps should take about 15 minutes.

Part 4: Team Building Step 2: Evaluation
========================================
This step contains the following sub-steps:

(1) I present all images to the team
(2) We look for siloing and diversity
    Diversity 1: within one person (i.e., mild or slight preferences - colorful images)
    Siloing: a lot of the same types or similar-looking images
    Diversity 2: within a team (i.e., images that show all four colors are covered)
(3) Optional (but recommended): People look up information on the web about their type
    For quick infographics: this stuff is very popular on pinterest
    [Prediction: "T" types won't go for this.]
(4) Each team member displays their image in their work area
    Coffee mugs, note books, mouse pads, screen saver, etc.
    Remote teams could use their images as their avatar
    (or maybe have a website or something...?)

The time needed for each of these sub-steps depends on
- the size of the team and
- how willing team members are to cooperate.

I'd prefer to work with small teams, and insist on working with teams that are growing.

Part 5: Team Building Step 3 (Optional): Action
===============================================
This step is optional.
If all four personality traits are covered by the current team members, there is no need to change that.

I Would Prefer to Work With Growing Teams

I Am Against Firing People
I am definitely against firing people!
I would hate to be responsible for someone getting fired because they are part of a silo
(excess of a single type).
So I have no desire to work with teams that are not looking to add people.

My Personal Recommendation
- Know your type, know your strengths
- Figure out how to find freelancing work
- Realize that there is no such thing as a "permanent position"

I Would Prefer to Work With Small Teams
Naturally it would be easiest to test out my theory on small teams, four people max.
These people would have to embrace their own preference and respect the other team members' preferences.

I would like to test this idea of building a psychologically diverse team on a few small teams other than my own.
This would be for a very low price, perhaps even for free (e.g., if you're already a friend of mine irl).
If you would be interested in participating in this pilot program, please contact me!

This step contains the following sub-steps:

(1) Figure out what type of person you want to hire to cover the four basic functions
(2) Figure out how to hire that type of person

This is outside my area of expertise.

However, if you agree that hiring based on internal rather than external characteristics,
I would hope that it opens up the candidate pool for you!

It's impossible to estimate how long each of these sub-steps will take
without information about the team dynamics and what changes are desired.
