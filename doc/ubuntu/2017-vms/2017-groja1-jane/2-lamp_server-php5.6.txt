 Get LAMP Sites Running
========================
LAMP as in LAM-PHP.  We do Python separately, and will not be doing it on this VM.

Because we are re-using the VM we created on bette, all this work is pretty much already done.

Test in Browser
---------------
[ ] Ensure Apache is Running
    upapa
[ ] Test in browser:
    http://groja1.seeourminds.com/
    It works, yay we are done!

Disk Space Spotcheck in VM
--------------------------
[ ] Disk Space Spotcheck:
    /: 2.5G/19G (15%)

Disk Space Spotcheck on jane
----------------------------
[ ] Disk Space Spotcheck:
    /: 6.7G/23G (31%)
    /var/lib/libvirt: 4.4G/48G (9%)

So, we have room for 10 more in our new partition, nice!


Copy/Back Up the VM - Notes
---------------------------
Because we were able to quickly recreate the VM on jane using just the
groja1.qcow2 file, we know that it is what we need to back up.

There's really no reason to back up the one on bette, because ultimately
we had to do very little to get it going.

-> If we are backing up to an ext4 file system,
     we just need the /var/lib/libvirt/images/groja1.qcow2 file
-> If we are backing up to a FAT32 file system,
     we need a tar file containing just the /var/lib/libvirt/images/groja1.qcow2 file

Final Steps
-----------
[ ] Use logrotate to rotate apache logs weekly
    Already set up when we created this VM on bette!
