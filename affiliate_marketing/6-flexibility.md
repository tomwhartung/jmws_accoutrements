Affiliate marketing changes a lot:

- Google has ended its program
- Barnes and Noble changed the company they were using, and didn't tell many people
- CJ Affiliate was originally Commission Junction
  - Companies merge and rebrand
- In section 6 "Term, Termination, Deactivation and Notices" CJ Affiliate's agreement states they can terminate me at any time

Therefore we need to build flexibility into our use of their links.
