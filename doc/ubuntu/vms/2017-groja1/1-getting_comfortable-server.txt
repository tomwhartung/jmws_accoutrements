 Getting Comfortable
=====================
Install the basic stuff we need to get around and do the other stuff.

This is the process we are running to set up the vm groja1.
-----------------------------------------------------------
The goal is to:

1. Downgrade to php5 and
2. Get the joomla 1.x version of groja.com/seeourminds.com working

Server Necessities for Comfortableness
--------------------------------------
[ ] Install any new updates
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
[ ] Install rcs, vim, subversion, openssh-server, git, git-svn, (??git-stuff, git-magic??)
    -> Note: many packages already installed
       See ./0-windows_install.txt, under Questions and Answers -> Packages to install
    sudo apt-get install rcs vim subversion
    sudo apt-get install openssh-server
    sudo apt-get install git git-svn
[ ] Setup static IP

      https://michael.mckinnon.id.au/2016/05/05/configuring-ubuntu-16-04-static-ip-address/
    As root:
      cd /etc/network
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l interfaces
      vi interfaces
      -> Update as indicated in References above
      address 192.168.122.50
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 10.0.0.1
      dns-nameservers 192.168.30.2 192.168.31.2
    NOTE:
      Restarting the network service (/etc/init.d/networking stop|start|restart) had no effect!
      Had to reboot for it to work!
[ ] Setup ssh
    As tomh in the VM (groja1):
      ssh-keygen
      cd .ssh
      mkdir ../tmp
      cp id_rsa.pub ../tmp
      mv id_rsa.pub id_rsa.pub-groja1
    As root on bette:
      cd /etc
      vi hosts    # add line with "192.168.122.50 groja1"
    As tomh on bette:
      cd
      cp .ssh/id_rsa.pub tmp/id_rsa.pub-bette
      cd tmp
      scp id_rsa.pub-bette groja1:/home/tomh/tmp
      scp groja1:/home/tomh/tmp/id_rsa.pub-groja1 .
      cat id_rsa.pub-groja1 ../.ssh/authorized_keys
      mv id_rsa.pub-groja1 ../.ssh/pubs
    As tomh in the VM (groja1):
      cd ~/.ssh
      mv ../tmp/id_rsa.pub-bette .
      cp id_rsa.pub-bette authorized_keys
      mkdir pubs
      mv id_rsa.pub-bette pubs
    As tomh on bette (test!):
      ssh groja1   ## this should work, if not, figure out what went wrong!
[ ] Create and test the standard ssh wrapper scripts:
    o ~/bin/lsGroja1
    o ~/bin/toGroja1
    o ~/bin/diffGroja1
    o ~/bin/fromGroja1
    As tomh on bette:
      cd /var/www/jmws_accoutrements
      cd bin/libs/bash
      vi remote_host_ls    # enable using script with groja1
      vi remote_host_from  # optional: enable using script with groja1
      ## Commit these remote_host_* scripts to github when they are working ok
      cd ~/bin
      cp lsRita lsGroja1
      cp fromRita fromGroja1
      cp toRita toGroja1
      cp diffRita diffGroja1
      vi *Groja1
      cd ~/tmp
      lsGroja1
      toGroja1 hello.txt
      fromGroja1 hello.txt
      diffGroja1 hello.txt
      cd ~/bin
      ci -l *Groja1
      toEmAll *Groja1   # for consistency...


[ ] Home Directory - should be minimal for servers
    Copy selected files and directories from home directory on another host
      .bashrc, .bash_aliases*, .gitconfig, .vimrc, backup, bin, r*

[ ] Set up root account: .bashrc, links to .bash_aliases*
    Must mount thumb drives manually in the server distro
    As root:
      cd /mnt
      mkdir usb
      mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
    Copy files to ~tomh and ~root as appropriate
    As root:
      ln -s ~tomh/.bash_aliases .
      ln -s ~tomh/.bash_aliases-ava  .
      ln -s ~tomh/bin  .
      ln -s ~tomh/.vimrc   .
      vi .bashrc    ## Add cusTOMizations
      which ci
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l .bashrc

[ ] Update /etc/hosts and verify ssh is working
    Installing openssh-server seems to be enough to get it going
    Combine public keys from other hosts into authorized_keys
    As tomh:
      ssh-keygen
      cd ~/.ssh
      cat pubs/* >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
      Push over a copy of /etc/hosts
    As root:
      cd /etc
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l hosts fstab
      cat hosts
      more ~tomh/tmp/hosts
      mv ~tomh/tmp/hosts .
      vi hosts
      ci -l hosts
    Test using ssh to get from host to host.

[ ] To support automounting of usb thumb drives
    References:
      https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount/USB
      https://usbmount.alioth.debian.org/
    As tomh:
      sudo apt-get -y install usbmount
