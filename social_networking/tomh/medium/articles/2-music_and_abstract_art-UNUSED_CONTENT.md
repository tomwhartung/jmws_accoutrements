# Music, Meaning, and Modern Art: "Part 0 of 3"

This is content originally written for the Music, Meaning, and Modern Art article but deemed to be outside of the purview for
any of the three parts of the series I ultimately decided to write.

I decided to save this content for possible future reference in a subsequent article.

# Unused Content!

The following unused content includes some text about:

- Possible ways to interpret Mondrian's Pure Neo-Plasticism paintings
- How Bob Marley's song War predicts that war will continue until society achieves equilibrium

## BYOM: Filling in Mondrian's Blanks

What if I told you that the opposites in Piet Mondrian's paintings can represent any pair of opposites, whatsoever?

Title and Attribution: Composition No. 10 - By Piet Mondrian, 1939-1942. Public Domain.

Take his Composition 10, for example.
Because this painting is so abstract and pure, the meaning of its elements is completely open to interpretation.

So, for example, the white areas could represent white people and the black areas could represent black people - or vice versa.
Or, the white areas could represent women and the black areas could represent men - or vice versa.
Or, the white areas could represent older people and the black areas could represent younger people - or vice versa.

Similarly, for example, the vertical lines could represent white people and the horizontal lines could represent
black people - or vice versa - and the white could just be the background.
Or, the vertical lines could represent women and the horizontal lines could represent men - or vice versa - and
the white could just be the background.
Or, the vertical lines could represent older people and the horizontal lines could represent younger people - or vice versa - and
the white could just be the background.

Or, the vertical lines could represent ______ and the horizontal lines could represent ______, and
the little colored boxes could represent ___ and ___ and ___!
Fill in the blanks as you see fit - human life is full of pairs of opposites!

And now you know the true nature of the power lying in Mondrian's Pure Neo-Plastic art!

## Bob Marley's song War, or, "I Want to Believe"

The important thing to realize is that, no matter what identity we assign to the opposites in this painting,
each pair opposites - black vs. white, horizontal vs. vertical, etc. - is in non-symmetrical equilibrium.
I want to believe this means that eventually things will work out, and people will be able to live in equilibrium.

The song
[War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPZydAotVOY)
by
[Bob Marley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley)
confirms that this is how things will turn out - or else.

```
Until the philosophy which hold one race superior
And another, inferior,
Is finally, and permanently,
Discredited, and abandoned,
Everywhere is war
Me say war.
```

Plus, I have eyes, I can see what's going on - and

## First-Person Opinion 1

To be honest, when I first learned this I was a bit pissed off!
Of course, punk rock was huge at the time so everyone listening to that was a bit pissed off about something!

In this case, I was a bit pissed off that I hadn't learned this sooner.
- It all makes such total sense, in some ways it's like, "duh."
- Too bad teachers think it's more important to teach us about wars and the like.

But sometimes it's nice to have things spelled out in black and white.
Hopefully this helps you better appreciate abstract art!

## First-Person Opinion 2

When I first learned about abstract art, I was ready for it, because by then I had spent years listening to the
rich variety of music available in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.
The purpose of this article is to share with you the awakening I experienced in this regard in the art classes
I took at Virginia Commonwealth University [VCU](https://www.vcu.edu) in the mid-1980s.

If you have difficulty understanding how this painting, [Fugue](https://curiator.com/art/wassily-kandinsky/fuga-fugue),
created by Wassily Kandinsky in 1914 could
[sell at Sotheby's in 1990 for $20.9 million](http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/work-101.php), or
if you think Piet Mondrian's paintings are "just a bunch of squares," this article is for you!
