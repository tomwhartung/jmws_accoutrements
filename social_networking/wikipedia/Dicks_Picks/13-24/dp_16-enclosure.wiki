== Enclosure ==

Included with the release is a single sheet folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure that fits snugly inside the CD case. The front of this enclosure duplicates the cover of the CD, and the back features a rectangular color photograph of the band on horseback out in the countryside, riding away from the photographer.  Under this photo is a white stripe across the page above a circular grey outline of a skull with the number 16 inside.

Inside the enclosure, the two pages contain a single wide black-and-white photograph of the band on horseback and facing the photographer.  Above the band members and against a background of trees is a list of the band's members along with credits for the release in the left-most column.  Three lists of tracks on the three CDs, also against a background of trees, take up the three columns on the remaining page-and-a-half.  Copyright information appears in fine print under Pigpen, who appears on the far right side of the photo.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 13, 2000.</ref>
