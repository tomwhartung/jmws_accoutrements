 Sometimes We Need to Vent
===========================
Sometimes....

Random Frustrations
-------------------
Job searching is like the new smoking.
I feel like I am doing it just out of habit.
It is not doing anything for me but sucking up time that could be put to much better use elsewhere.
Feels like jumping through randomly-placed invisible hoops that I cannot see until it's too late
The process is broken, run largely out of fear and ignorance; I am really sick of being victimized by this.
Feels like I am trying to fit into oddly-shaped places, and when my effort fails, the only feedback is "you didn't fit."

Developer Stereotypes
---------------------
Developers are seen by many as being a mere commodity.
Many see us as being an unfeeling extension of the machines to be tossed aside when old and broken.
It's amazing to listen to people's stereotypes, and those who wish to fight these.

More Positive Spins on All This
-------------------------------
It seems as though I am supposed to somehow predict these companies' needs and satisfy them in advance.
   This is a big part of what's behind the Device Detection work.
Seems like it would be much easier to say "I am this shape, if you want one of these services, let me know, else go away."
