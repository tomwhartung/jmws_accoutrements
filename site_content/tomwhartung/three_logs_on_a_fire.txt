 Reasons for Switching to 1099 Part Time Work
==============================================

 Three Logs on the Fire
------------------------

Describe Situation: minimally
- Love technology
- Love variety
- Technology is changing more and more quickly
- Technology is getting more and more varied
- My theory: recessions getting worse
  - Predict the next one will be worse than the last
  - Hope I am wrong!
  - Cannot predict when it will happen
  - Goal is to prepare for the worst, though
- When recessions hit, companies go to the 1099 marketplace to get thier work done
- I want to be able to find work for the next 20-30 years minimum

Underlying Situation: add if appropriate....
- Underlying: I feel comfortable with people and tech, but feel my Achilles heel
   is a lack of knowledge about practical business matters.
- Underlying: case in point: fear that clients will not pay me.
- Underlying: never felt I had to cultivate references because I do "good work,"
   with technology changing so fast and all businesses now needing websites, I feel
   there is no consensus on what constitutes "good work."

Describe Goals: main part of article
- "Three logs on the fire"
- Consider this a minimum
- Want to have time to learn new tech as soon as it comes out
- Willing to predict that the longer it takes, the worse it will be
- Ideally would like to find ways to do five different types of work - one for each day of the week
- Realistically willing to take on projects that last 3-4 days/week for a few weeks at a time
- Goal is to identify at least five ways to make money, so that if I lose two I still have
  "Three logs on the fire"

Describe Actions:
1. Preparing personal websites
2. Get back to my meetup with new promotional stories and material (pitches)
3. Try to find small projects locally
4. Create profiles and use sites like upwork to find small projects
5. Cut back gradually so I am spending only one or two days on personal websites
6. Monitor income and levels of success and frustration, and adjust actions accordingly
