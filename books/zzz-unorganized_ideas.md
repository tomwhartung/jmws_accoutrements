Here are a few unorganized ideas left over from the brainstorming process used to create the outline for the marketing book.

Who knows, maybe they will help with something someday.

## Unorganized Ideas

- Some jobs require us to be more logical than emotional
  - E.g., require working with things when someone would prefer to work with people
- It's easier to sell logic than emotion, because logic is universal
  - Or is it

## More Personal Ideas

- Want to disrupt stereotypes based on demographics
- Sick of the voice in my head that categorizes and judges others based on superficial BS
