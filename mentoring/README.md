Thoughts about mentoring.

# Mentoring Based on Type

It seems to me it would be extremely helpful to  know some basics about the
personality of the person being mentored.

I learned about this book in Cal Newport's So Good They Can't Ignore You.

- **Do What You Are - Discover the Perfect Career for You Through the Secrets of Personality Type**
- By Paul D. Tieger, Barbara Barron, and Kelly Tieger

Cal does not care for this idea, but I can't remember off hand exactly why.
Suffice it to say he recommends taking a different tact altogether - and I think
that could be because he's definitley an INT-something, wink wink.

I beg to differ, and believe all advice needs to be taken with a grain of salt.
