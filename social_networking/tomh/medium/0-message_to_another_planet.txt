 Greetings From Planet INxx
============================
Sometimes I feel like I'm on the wrong planet.

This article explains why.

An understanding of these types helps me understand and more easily tolerate people who are different from me.
This is valuable because my type is under-represented.

I'm weird and I know it:
------------------------
Most people don't know what it's like to have a personality that's in the minority.
Such is the nature of minorities.

This is not to say I want some sort of special rights or anything.
Just want to say "hi" from my world.
