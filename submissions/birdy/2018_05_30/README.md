Birdy submissions.

Post any of these that Birdy doesn't want online, probably medium would be best.
Then post links to the article on social networking sites.

Actually, check with Birdy to see if posting them online, and plugging their magazine in an intro to the article, is ok.

# Checklist

Check these off when they are done.
Word counts are for the article ONLY, and do not include the titles or footnotes, just the article.
