Sites with reviews of hosting providers recommended for python-based sites.

Ideally, one with a free tier would be nice, especially for the sites on the back burner right now.

# Part 1: Lists and Reviews

Interestingly, at first blush there seems to be very little overlap.

- Includes the providers I have been thinking about
  - https://djangostars.com/blog/top-django-compatible-hosting-services/
- Start with free hosting, then scale up as necessary - sounds good!
  - https://marginhound.com/free-python-hosting-a-guide-to-finding-it-using-it-for-small-projects-and-scaling-up/
- Displayed at the top of the list of search results
  - These include a section on "Why You Donâ€™t Want Free Python Hosting:"
  - I *suspect* these guys are into affiliate marketing
    - And therefore free hosting earns them $0.00 in commision!
  - https://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/best-python-hosting/
  - https://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/best-django-hosting/
- Following the initial list is a longer section diving into each one -- presumably, at least
  - https://hostingtribunal.com/best/django-hosting/
- Mentions google cloud, initially my top choice, having seen their presentation, at the end:
  - https://geekflare.com/python-hosting-platform/

There are probably more, but that's a good start.

# Part 2: Providers

These are providers I would look at.

- AWS - Amazon Web Services
  - https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/deploy-python-application/
- Python Anywhere
  - Mentioned in multiple lists in Part 1
  - https://www.pythonanywhere.com
