 Get LAMP Sites Running
========================
LAMP as in LAM-PHP.  We do Python separately.

Ensure Required LAMP Packages Are Installed
-------------------------------------------
Many if not most or all of these LAMP packages have been already installed
[ ] Install as necessary, and ensure the installed versions of these packages match on:
    [ ] ava
    [ ] barbara
    [ ] jane
    Commands (as root):
      dpkg-query -l 'package_name_or_regex'   ## if it's not found, it needs to be installed
      apt-get install -s package_name         ## Simulate installation
      apt-get install -y package_name         ## Do it without requesting confirmation
    Install apache2, apache2-utils, apache2-dev (needed for wsgi)
    Install libapache2-mod-php7.0
    Install php7.0, php7.0-gd, php7.0-mysql, php7.0-mcrypt
    Install mysql-server

Configure Apache
----------------
[ ] Add and update config files in /etc/apache2/sites-available as appropriate
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l *.conf   ## "Installed version"
    For best results, copy conf files from another host and check in to RCS
    Fix ServerAlias specifications in apache2/sites-available/*.conf files
    As root:
      ci -l *.conf   ## "Copied from host xxxxx and updated for this host"
[ ] Config files in /etc/apache2/sites-avaialble
->  For 16.04, copy conf files from jane or barbara:
    Already vetted currently used versions against the new 000-default.conf for 16.04, no changes needed!
[ ] Enable mod_rewrite and php7.0, and start apache2 (as root):
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2
      ls -al mods-*/rewrite*
      ls -al mods-*/php7.0*
      ls -al mods-*/mpm*
    If not enabled (or disabled, as in the case of mpm_event),
      run one or more of these commands as appropriate:
[ ] Enable mod_rewrite and php7.0, and start apache2 (as root):
    As root:
      a2enmod rewrite
      a2enmod php7.0
      a2dismod mpm_event
      a2enmod mpm_prefork
[ ] Check that we have not yet enabled any sites:
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2
      ls -al l sites*/*.conf
    Only the sites-available/000-default.conf file should be linked to
      the sites-enabled directory
    cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
    ln -s ../sites-available/0[1-9]*.conf .
[ ] Put our standard, behind-the-firewall version of index.html file in /var/www
    As tomh on bette:
      cd /var/www/
      toJane index.html
[ ] Restart apache and test in browser, to ensure we are good to go.
    As root:
      service apache2 stop
      service apache2 start
    Access in browser:
      http://localhost
    Should see our standard, behind-the-firewall version of index.html

Populate /var/www
-----------------
[ ] Get all websites' source files in /var/www
    Copy all of /var/www from an existing host or,
       for a painfully detailed process, see this section
       in ../2016-jane-2/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt or
          ../2016-ava/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt
[ ] Fix ServerAlias specifications in apache2/sites-available/*.conf files
    For barbara change "jane" to "barbara" in conf files
    service apache2 start
    Disk Space Spotcheck: /: 4.2G/13G (35%); /home: 0.5G/9G (6%); and /var/www: 5.6G/10G (59%)

[ ] Disk Space Spotcheck:
      /: 4.2G/13G (35%)
      /home: 0.5G/9G (6%)
      /var/www: 5.6G/10G (59%)

Populate databases
------------------
[ ] Databases used on barbara:
    groja.com & seeourminds.com:
      try using current db from lauren:
        seeourminds.com-2016_07_16-lauren.sql.gz
      try using current db from bette:
        seeourminds.com-2016_07_16-bette.sql.gz
    joomoowebsites.com: using db from bette (version 3.5.1)
        joomoowebsites.com-2016_07_16-bette-02-mobile_detect.sql.gz
    tomhartung.com: using db from bette
        tomwhartung.com-2016_07_16-bette.sql.gz

Getting All Sites to Work
-------------------------
For details about this process, see the corresponding sections in
    ../2016-jane-2/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt or
    ../2016-ava/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt
[ ] Ensure Static Sites Work
    artsyvisions.com
    groja.com
    tomh.info
[ ] Ensure LAMP CMS Sites Work
    tomwhartung.com
    joomoowebsites.com
    tomhartung.com

Additional Joomla Caveat
------------------------
For details about this process, see the corresponding sections in
    ../2016-jane-2/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt or
    ../2016-ava/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt
[ ] For joomla on a fresh install of 16.04, install simplexml:
    Check for it in phpinfo.php
       sudo apt-get install php7.0-simplexml
       sudo service apache2 restart
    Reference: http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?t=916040

Install Drush Using apt-get
---------------------------
Tried installing this a couple of ways on jane, using composer, based on up-to-date info on docs.drush.org
Unfortunately that process did not work.
For details about steps taken on jane, and why I suspect those steps failed, see
    ../2016-jane-2/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt or
    ../2016-ava/2-lamp_server-virtual_hosts.txt
[ ] Using apt-get:
    As tomh:
      sudo apt-get install drush
      which drush      ## /usr/bin/drush
      drush --version  ## drush version 5.10.0

Back It All Up

[ ] Ensure we have backups of everything, including a copy for off-site
[ ] Set up (semi-)automatic backups as appropriate

    /home: 
    /var/www: X.XG/XXG (XX%)
