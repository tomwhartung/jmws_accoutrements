NOTE: This is part 1 - a little over 300 words.
I have some questions at the end.

Introduction
The cost of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) security cameras continues to decline, making them easy to afford.

You can rely on the 2D Electronics Design and Consulting Services Division to design and install a security system that fits both your needs and your budget.

Commercial Security
Business owners can implement measures such as the following to increase the security of their business:

- Video Monitoring: surveillance cameras
- Access Control: keyed and electronic locks
- Alarms: door and window alarms, and motion detectors

This article focuses on CCTV security cameras.

Security Camera Options
The wide variety of cameras available today gives business owners many options.

- Systems may be wired or wireless
- Cameras may be fixed or mobile, allowing an operator to tilt, pan, or zoom in
- High resolution streams offer more detail but require more storage space
- Low resolution streams offer less detail but also require less storage space
- Systems can be designed to work at night or in other conditions where the lighting is low
- Some applications may require systems to be covert or vandal resistant, or both
- Some options support the ability to supplement the feed with high-resolution photographs
- These high-resolution systems are capable of helping to identify culprits and can even read license plates
- Modern options allow business owners to view one or more feeds live on phone

Along with the cost associated with each of these options, each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

The experts at 2D Electronics can help you design a system customized to your specific needs and budget.

Modern CCTV Systems
As technological developments continue to be made in the industry, new features continue to appear in these camera systems.

Modern digital surveillance systems can "multiplex" the images from more than one source onto a single storage device.  This allows:

- Storing more visual streams on less disk space
- Accessing these streams simultaneously

Motion-activated cameras are also available, allowing for the storage of more streams in less space.
These cameras can be set up to trigger alarms and record at higher resolutions when monitoring movement.

Leading-edge technology supports tracking movement with multiple cameras through Video Content Analysis (VCA)

The latest technology also supports facial recognition.

Questions:
1. Is this OK, on the right track?
2. How to finish?  Dig deeper into cameras, or move on to alarm systems?
Thanks!
