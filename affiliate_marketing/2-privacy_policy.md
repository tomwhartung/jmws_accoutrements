Ok, it's becoming obvious that, if I want to set up some affiliate marketing, I need a Privacy Policy.

Yikes (I could get sued) and hmm (more stuff to learn about) and ugh (legalese, ugh).

## Requirements

- Privacy Policy (PP) must be general yet specific enough to use on any of my sites
- The PP should allow for:
  - Displaying AdSense ads
  - Selling (or giving away) images
  - Affiliate marketing
  - Building a list of fans' email addresses
  - Ask for donations

### Informative Pages

These explain why I should have both the PP and the ToS and how to ensure users are aware of them.

  - Creating a compliance plan: https://termsfeed.com/blog/gdpr-compliance-plan/

Importantly: "Unless you can absolutely guarantee that no users from the EU will ever find their way to your website,
you’ll need a GDPR notice and compliant consent measures."  (From the last link in the above list.)

## Process

1. Try a bunch of the generators
2. Pick the best and closest one to start with
3. Add in any updates needed from the other ones
4. Customize further if needed

### Sites to Use:

Doing this first batch made me decide to do more:

- Simple, try first - #10 on list:
  - https://getterms.io/
- Popular in search results - #6 on list:
  - https://www.iubenda.com/
- Site has good articles about PP and ToS - #3 on list:
  - https://termsfeed.com/

After doing those, decided to review the list again and try a few more:

- #1 on list - run by same people who created the list
  - https://privacypolicies.com/
- #4 on list - being on a strict budget, I like the idea of it being free
  - https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/
- #5 on list - covers Commission Junction and AdSense
  - http://www.privacypolicyonline.com/
- #7 on list - offers a seal
  - https://www.trust-guard.com/

## 1 - Simple, First Try: https://getterms.io/

- Using seeourminds.com
- Very short form to fill out:
  - Website address
  - Company name
  - State or Location
  - Policy effective date
- Used default "website" option to generate both the privacy policy and terms
  - 2-privacy_policy-1-getterms_io-website.html
  - 2-privacy_policy-1-getterms_io-website.txt
  - 3-terms_of_service-1-getterms_io-website.html
  - 3-terms_of_service-1-getterms_io-website.txt
- It is very minimal but better than nothing
  - They openly claim it is only a starting point
  - Their policy is much more extensive: https://getterms.io/privacy/
- Tried creating both the policy and the terms using the "blog" option, but got only terms (no policy)
  - 3-terms_of_service-1-getterms_io-blog.html
  - 3-terms_of_service-1-getterms_io-blog.txt
- Other options: Custom: $5; Comprehensive: $15
- Rest of site: nothing I haven't already seen on WikiHow, etc.
