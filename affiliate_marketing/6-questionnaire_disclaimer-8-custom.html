<h2>Website General Disclaimer</h2>
<p>As stated in the <a href='/legal/privacy_policy#general-disclaimer' title='Link to the General Disclaimer section on the page containing the Privacy Policy at at this site' target='_blank'>General Disclaimer</a> section of our <a href='/legal/privacy_policy' title='Link to the page containing the Privacy Policy at at this site' target='_blank'>Privacy Policy</a>:</p>

<p>The SeeOurMinds.com quiz is part of the SeeOurMinds.com website, and as such this General Disclaimer fully applies to the quiz.</p>

<h2>Quiz Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The SeeOurMinds.com quiz makes absolutely <em>no</em> attempt to diagnose mental health issues, and should <em>not</em> be understood as providing any type of diagnosis or healthcare recommendation.</p>
<p>Our questionnaire is intended to be fun and educational.  Our hope is that it will help increase your awareness of your psychological preferences, which may be subconscious in nature.  However, the SeeOurMinds quiz is explicitly <em>not</em> intended to be a tool for diagnosing any type of health or mental health condition.</p>

<h2>Quiz Accuracy</h2>
<p>The <a href='/legal/privacy_policy#general-disclaimer' title='Link to the General Disclaimer section on the page containing the Privacy Policy at at this site' target='_blank'>General Disclaimer</a> section of our <a href='/legal/privacy_policy' title='Link to the page containing the Privacy Policy at at this site' target='_blank'>Privacy Policy</a>, quoted above for your convenience, naturally also applies to results of the SeeOurMinds.com Quiz.</p>
<p>We have made every effort to ensure the quiz results are both informative and accurate, but our resources are limited.  We encourage you to seek out similar quizzes online and consider those results as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, the SeeOurMinds.com quiz is a work in progress, and at this time I do not feel comfortable offering any sort of guarantee it yields accurate results.</p>
<h3>In Search of Accuracy</h3>
<p>If accuracy is important to you, definitely seek out and take other quizzes, to get the opinions different quiz creators.</p>
<p>You may also want to be aware of others who may be influencing your sense of self.  Your answers may even be unconsiously influenced by the expections of society as a whole, internalized by decades of experiences in your day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Another consideration is, we all &mdash; quiz takers and creators alike &mdash; have our own biases.  Ultimately it is up to you to decide what your preferences are.</p>
<p>Finally, observing others and even learning to be mindful can help you understand any external and internal forces you may be experiencing, but these topics are far outside the scope of this disclaimer.</p>

<h2>Saving Your Results</h2>
<p>The SeeOurMinds.com quiz allows you to store your quiz results on our server under your email address.  Using this option, the quiz page enables you to save your answers on our server and retrieve, change, and add to them when you return.</p>
<p>Note that <b>using your email address to save your quiz results does <em>not</em> sign you up for our newsletter.</b>  To sign up for our newsletter, use one of the forms on the site that is labeled specifically for that purpose.</p>
<h3>Why Save Your Results?</h3>
<p>The ability to save your results on our server exists solely for your convenience.</p>
<p>Saving them allows you to, for example, save your answers for a shorter quiz and come back later and answer additional questions.  This feature also lets you go back and change a few answers to see how that might effect the score.  Finally, saving them also means you can access your results at any time without needing to write them down.</p>

<ul>
 <li>We do not care about your results and have no desire to look at them.</li>

</ul>
<p>However, also note we reserve the right to view your results if:</p>

 <li>In your request you state you want us to use the saved results to create the portrait.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Other Resources</h2>
<p>Self-administered psychological screening tests may help to enhance self-awareness of one’s own experiences, but what any individual chooses to do &mdash; or ‘should’ choose to do &mdash; with the results of any given test, is a matter for the individual to decide and should not be dictated by the test itself.</p>
