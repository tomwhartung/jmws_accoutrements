# Major Points to Touch On

## Introduction

This is part 2, for part 1 see [link].

## Cezanne

In Part 1 of The Complete Works of Mondrian [check title], he frequently mentions cubism and the Plastic Means.

Indeed, he calls his work Neo-Plasticism.  This term even appears in the title of many of his works.

So I started reading the Cubist Epoch by ___, 19??.

This book in turn frequently mentions Cezanne, so I checked seven books about him out from the library.
[Mention curbside holds, and the fact that two people had to carry them out to me in my car?]

One of these books finally showed me exactly what is meant by "The Plastic Means."

## The Plastic Means

The book Cezanne's Composistions, by ___, 19?? has a chapter named Glossary, which defines this term.

It turns out, my guess regarding what the term means was fuzzy, but close.

Most significantly, this book compares Cezanne's paintings with photographs of his motifs.

These comparisons are incredibly valuable for those seeking to understand why Cezanne is considered the father of Modern Art.

## De Stijl

This article reflects the content of Part 1 of The Complete Works of Mondrian [check title].

This part of the book, which comprises [check: 1/3, 1/2, etc.] of the book consists of the articles he wrote for the magazine founded and run [check] by Theo Van Doesburg.

Summarize the content of this part, highlighting unique articles.

- Early expository [??] articles
- Dialog
- Trialog
- Articles about other art forms such as music, architecture, and literature
  - Modern-day industrial music

## Conclusion

Mondrian was a major influence on my GROJAs.

These images may lack aesthetic appeal, but I feel they do an excellent job of representing the opposites in Jung's model of personality.

Plus, I am convinced that the [general] public [as a whole] is not yet ready for purely abstract art.

Now that I am retired, I have decided to update my idea of visualizing personalities to use the FFM rather than Jungian Archetypes.

Looking at paintings by Picasso, Braque, and Gris is giving me many ideas for how I might visually represent the OCEAN factors.

Also, because cubist images are abstract, yet also contain recognizable images, I believe the [general] public [as a whole] will be more receptive to these images.
