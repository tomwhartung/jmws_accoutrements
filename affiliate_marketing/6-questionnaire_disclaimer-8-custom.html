<h1>The SeeOurMinds.com Quiz Disclaimer</h1>
<p>Effective date: July 19, 2018</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>JooMoo WebSites LLC ("us", "we", or "our") operates the {{ site_name }} website.</p>
<p>This website offers the <a href='https://seeourminds.com/quiz' title='Link to the SeeOurMinds quiz on this site'>SeeOurMinds quiz</a> for entertainment and enlightenment purposes only, and assumes no responsibility for the accuracy, or lack thereof, of its results.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer, Accuracy, Etc.</h2>
<p>To be perfectly honest, the main reason this quiz is online at this time is so I can get some feedback on it. I suppose we will come up with some sort of official disclaimer some day, for now, please just take things with a grain of salt.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Most importantly, this quiz is a work in progress, and at this time I am not by any means ready to guarantee that it will give you an accurate result!</p>

<h3>Sharing Your Email Address</h3>
<p>Sharing your email address on the quiz page enables you to save your answers on our server and retrieve, change, and add to them when you return.</p>
<p>Note: sharing your email address on the quiz page does NOT sign you up for our newsletter! To do that, use the form in the aside that is labeled specifically for that purpose.</p>

<h3>If accuracy is important to you...</h3>
<p>If accuracy is important to you, please take other quizzes and get a variety of opinions. And if you really want to learn exactly what your four letter type is, by all means take the real MBTI® instrument!</p>

<h3>I've had a lot of fun writing this quiz!</h3>
<p>It's been a real challenge to come up with the questions without borrowing too heavily from Briggs-Meyers and Keirsey — and I love a good challenge!</p>
<p>And I've had even more fun with writing the code to support having a different type of quiz! Note that it allows visitors to:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Answer a varying number of questions.</li>
 <li>Pick from a varying number of options (rather than just two either/or options).</li>
 <li>Opt-out of answering some of the more experimental (fun) questions that appear towards the end, in the longer versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I am definitely not willing to claim it is accurate, at least, not yet!</p>

<h2>Disclaimer: Limitations of Psychological Self-Tests and Screening Quizzes</h2>
<p>From https://counsellingresource.com/quizzes/testing-disclaimer/</p>
<p>The screening tests and other psychological self-tests provided at this site are intended for educational purposes only and should not be understood to constitute any type of diagnosis or healthcare recommendation.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer and Our Views on Psychological Testing</h3>
<p>Our quizzes are intended to be fun and educational, and they may help increase your awareness of particular experiences or of particular forms of psychological distress. They are not by themselves tools for diagnosing any type of health or mental health condition.</p>
<p>Psychological tests and quizzes at CounsellingResource.com should not be understood as providing any type of diagnosis or healthcare recommendation.</p>
<p>In the view of this site, self-administered psychological screening tests may help to enhance self-awareness of one’s own experiences, but cannot give any well-informed recommendation about what should be done about those experiences. In other words, by asking about particular experiences, a psychological test may simply help highlight elements of those experiences. Having those experiences highlighted may offer you an opportunity to reflect on them at greater length, or to consider their relevance in a broader life context. What any individual chooses to do — or ‘should’ choose to do — with the results of any given test, is a matter for the individual and should not be dictated by the test itself.</p>

<h3>More Information on Protecting Your Privacy</h3>
<p>For further information about how this site protects your privacy and confidentiality with respect to psychological self tests, please see our note “Psychological Self-Tests and Your Privacy”.</p>

<h3>More Information on Psychological Distress, Counselling and Psychotherapy</h3>
<p>For further information about diagnostic criteria for some of the forms of psychological distress which these screening tests address, please check the Mental Health Reference site.</p>
<p>Our section “About Counselling and Psychotherapy”, as well as our online therapy information (“Online Therapy and Online Counselling”), can answer many of the questions you might have about seeking counselling or therapy.</p>
