# Outline

## Introduction

This article is for people who like music but do not like abstract art.

## Music and Particular Forms

Specific songs and albums:

### All Along the Watchtower

- Very painterly
- Impending doom
- This is not a blues song

### Jazz Is More Abstract

Especially if it doesn't have lyrics.

#### John Coltrane - A Love Supreme

- His magnum opus
- http://www.wbur.org/artery/2014/10/10/coltrane-love-supreme-50
- It is very spiritual
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Love_Supreme
- But not sure this is the song I'm thinking about
  - I.e., not the expression of his thoughts on the civil rights movement
  - See Alabama below
- Maybe look it up in the Miles Davis book?
- Compare to Blackbird by The Beatles
- NYTimes article (limited number of articles viewable per month!):
  - http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/23/arts/music-coltrane-at-75-the-man-and-the-myths.html

#### John Coltrane - Alabama

- Might be a better idea
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_(John_Coltrane_song)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saN1BwlxJxA
- Compare to Blackbird by The Beatles

#### Miles Davis - Bitches Brew

- Maybe just stick to Coltrane for now (KISS)
- Definitely my favorite though

### First Four Talking Heads Albums

They were students at RISD so were familiar with abstract art.

- All their songs are very painterly.
- Maybe mention a song from each.

#### Talking Heads 77

- Psycho Killer
  - Not about any specific person
  - Associated with Son of Sam because of timing of release
  - Actually written years before that
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_Killer

#### More Songs About Buildings and Food

- For Artists Only

#### Fear of Music

- Maybe Life During Wartime?

#### Remain in Light

- Once in a Lifetime
