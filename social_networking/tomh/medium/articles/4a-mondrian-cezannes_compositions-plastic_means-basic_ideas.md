# Basic Ideas -- Kind of an Outline

Some ideas are fleshed out better than others.

## Introduction

This is part 2, for part 1 see [link].

This part focuses on what Mondrian means by the word "plastic."

## Plastic Means Versus Plastic Material

The New Art -- The New Life, The Collected Writings of Piet Mondrian, is a book edited and translated by Henry Holtzman and Martin S. James.
It was first published in 1986.

In the past I've checked out copies of this book from the library, and read the articles that had interesting-sounding titles.

Recently I obtained my very own copy of this book, and decided to take a more methodical approach, reading the articles in chronological order.

The articles in this book frequently use the term "plastic."

Indeed, he calls his work Neo-Plasticism, and this term appears in the title of many of his articles.

## Cezanne, Cubism, and The New Plastic

Mondrian frequently mentions cubism and the "plastic means."

So I started reading the Cubist Epoch by Douglas Cooper, 1971.

This book in turn frequently mentions Cezanne, so I checked seven books about him out from the library.
[Mention curbside holds, and the fact that two people had to carry them out to me in my car?]

One of these books finally showed me exactly what is meant by "The Plastic Means."

## The Plastic Means

Section III in the book Cezanne's Composistions, by Earle Loran, 1943 is named An Illustrated Glossary, and defines this term.

It turns out, my guess regarding what the term means was fuzzy, but close.

Most significantly, this book compares Cezanne's paintings with photographs of his motifs.

These comparisons are incredibly valuable for those seeking to understand why Cezanne is considered the father of Modern Art.
