Signing up at:

- https://signup.cj.com/member/signup/publisher/#/?_k=iewapd
- Minimal form: select language (En), enter first and last name, email, and done.
- That got me an email that took me to a longer form - but not as long as the one for pbs.
- Among other things, the Service Agreement says:
  - I need a Privacy Policy, hmm.
  - Account goes dormant if no activity for six months
- Also had to sign off on:
  - Software Policy: http://www.cj.com/legal/software-policy
  - Privacy Policy: https://www.conversantmedia.com/legal/privacy
- Instantly accepted, it's saying I can log in!
