This file contains details on how to:

* Test the Let's Encrypt certificates and
* Back everything up, etc.

# Goal

Verify we can use https to access all of these sites:

* artsyvisions.com (Static)
* tomh.info (Static)
* groja.com (Python/Wsgi - Flask)
* seeourminds.com (Python/Wsgi - Django)
* joomoowebsites.com (LAMP CMS - Joomla)
* tomhartung.com (LAMP CMS - Drupal)
* tomwhartung.com (LAMP CMS - WordPress)

# Background

This file details the final steps in this process.

**All of the steps in all of the processes in all of the other files in this
directory must be performed before the steps in this one.**

For an overview of the goals and reasons for doing all this, see the `../README.md` file:

- https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_accoutrements/blob/master/doc/devops/https-ssl/README.md

# Process

**All commands must be run as root.**

## Step (1) Test in Browser

This is where it would be nice to be able to test this on a non-production host, but
we can implement Let's Encrypt only on hosts connected to the internet!

- [ ] Test all four forms of the basic url.  For example if we are testing groja.com, test:
  - http://groja.com
  - http://www.groja.com
  - https://groja.com
  - https://www.groja.com
- [ ] Ensure all four forms of the url redirect to https://www.groja.com
- [ ] Ensure that they all have the green icon.

## Step (2): Check into RCS

When all config files are working, check them into RCS - quickly, before we mess something up!

- [ ] Run the following commands to ensure the latest versions are checked in to RCS:
```
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
rcsdiff *.conf
ci -l *.conf
```

## Step (3): Automatic Renewal

The Let's Encrypt certificates expire after 90 days.

It is possible, however, to set up a cronjob to renew them automatically.

  - This article describes how to set use the `crontab` command to do this

### Renewal Works on `ava` only

**Note:** The renewal command does **not** run on the backup host `barbara` ,
because it is not accessible from the internet without changing the
configuration of our modems and routers.

### Dry Run (`ava` only!)

Enter the following command to test certificate renewal:

```
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

**Note:** This command will **not** run on the backup host `barbara`.

### Renewal Command (`ava` only!)

Enter the following command within 30 days of the certificates' expiration date:

```
sudo certbot renew
```

**Note:** This command will **not** run on the backup host `barbara`.

### Cronjob Setup

Run the following commands to create a cronjob that automatically renews the certificates:

As root:
```
vi cronjob     # Enter text corresponding to the output of the crontab -l command below
crontab cronjob
crontab -l
#
# Check the Let's Encrypt certificates for expiration every day at 3:15 AM.
#
15 3 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet
```

## Step (4): Conclusion

Having three config files for each site, with names that follow the standard,
makes it super-easy to switch between http and https.

### Further Testing

When it runs successfully, `certbot`'s output includes a message such as the following:
```
Congratulations! You have successfully enabled https://tomhartung.com and
https://www.tomhartung.com

You should test your configuration at:
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=tomhartung.com
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=www.tomhartung.com
```

TO DO: test all of the sites with urls such as the following:

- https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=www.tomhartung.com
