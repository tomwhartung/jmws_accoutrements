Tried setting up some affiliate marketing on a few sites, and the assholes at pepperjam declined me.
BASTARDS!

Well I think it's because I don't have a Privacy Policy or a Terms of Service, so completing those is on the TODO list!

Meanwhile, moving what I did for pepperjam (for PBS) to this file.

## Starting Points

TO-DON'T:

Maybe they declined me because I didn't do **this**?

- Fill out W-9 form and fax to 877-286-4889

I sent them an email asking why and they didn't respond.
BASTARDS!
