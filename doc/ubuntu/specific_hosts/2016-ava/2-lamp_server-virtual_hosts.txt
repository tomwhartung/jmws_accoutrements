===================
Many if not most or all of these have been already installed
[ ] Install as necessary, and ensure the installed versions of these packages match on:

    [ ] jane
    Install apache2, apache2-utils, libapache2-mod-php7.0 as necessary and verify version consistency
    Install php7.0, php7.0-gd, php7.0-mysql, php7.0-mcrypt as necessary and verify version consistency
    Install mysql-server as necessary and verify version consistency

[ ] Config files in /etc/apache2/sites-avaialble

    Already vetted currently used versions against the new 000-default.conf for 16.04, no changes needed!
[ ] Enable mod_rewrite and php7.0, and start apache2 (as root):
    a2enmod rewrite

    a2dismod mpm_event
    a2enmod mpm_prefork
    cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
    ln -s ../sites-available/0[1-9]*.conf .
[ ] Get all websites' source files in /var/www
[ ] Fix ServerAlias specifications in apache2/sites-available/*.conf files
