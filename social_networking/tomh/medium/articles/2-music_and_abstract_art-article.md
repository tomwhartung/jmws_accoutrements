# Title

Having trouble deciding on a title.

- **Music and Particular Forms** - really leaning toward this one

Other ideas:

- Abstract Music
- Music and Abstract Art
- Abstract Music and Abstract Art
-

# Idea: Limit Use of First and Second Person

Idea: **only the last paragraph of each section should contain first or second pronouns.**

This is where I sum things up for the reader by talking to them directly.

# Outline With Comments and Links

## Introduction

This article is for people who like music but do not like abstract art.
In particular, if you think Piet Mondrian's paintings are "just a bunch of squares,"
this article is for you.

Using examples of popular songs, this article explains how artists
add flexibility and hence new meanings to their work by substituting abstractions for particular forms.

This article also teaches you how to add your own particular forms to abstract art when you hear and see it.

### Please Omit?!?!

**[Maybe just leave this bit of negativity out of it:]**
If you are a Nazi Racist Fuck (NRF), then you will not like this article.
By all means, please feel free to consider it [degenerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art) and
go get on to your NRF-y life.
[I feel it and enjoyed typing it but **do we really need it?  Probably not.**]

## Music and Particular Forms

Specific songs and albums:

### All Along the Watchtower

- Very vague, in a painterly sort of way
  - Wtf is a "watchtower" anyway?
  - It's totally dislocated in time
  - And who is it about?  In one verse it's a joker and a thief, the next it's businessmen, then suddenly there are riders and princes
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower
- Impending doom
- But it is widely recognized as one of the best songs of all time.

This is not a blues song, but it is only three chords.
No matter your level of experience with playing music, you could learn to play it in minutes.
It might take someone who is totally inept up to an hour.

Very painterly - but closer to impressionism or cubism than to Kandinsky's totally abstract paintings or Mondrian's Pure Neo-Plastic works

The point is, All Along the Watchtower is highly abstract - or at the very least certainly free of consistent particular forms -
and yet also highly accessible.

If you can accept this song - which requires a bit of filling in the blanks - you can begin to appreciate abstract art.

### Jazz Is More Abstract

Especially if it doesn't have lyrics.

#### John Coltrane - Alabama

About the church that burned, killing four little girls.

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saN1BwlxJxA
- Really no way to know this without the title and knowl
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_(John_Coltrane_song)
- Without those clues, it could just as easily be similar in theme to Ray Charles' Georgia

(Closer with first or second pronouns, possibly both.)

#### John Coltrane - A Love Supreme

- His magnum opus
- http://www.wbur.org/artery/2014/10/10/coltrane-love-supreme-50
- It is very spiritual
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Love_Supreme
- But not sure this is the song I'm thinking about
  - I.e., not the expression of his thoughts on the civil rights movement
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll3CMgiUPuU
- Compare to Blackbird by The Beatles
- NYTimes article (limited number of articles viewable per month!):

#### Miles Davis - Quote From His Autobiography

I first clued in to the significance of what Trane was about when I read the following passage
in Miles Davis' autobiography.
He states it quite beautifully; I really have nothing to add to this.

[Here is the whole thing, from pp. 285-286 of his Autobiography, written with Quincy Troupe and published in 1989.]

```
Trane's music and what he was playing during the last two or three years [1965-1967]
of his life represented, for many blacks, the fire and passion and rage and anger and rebellion and love that they felt,
especially among the young black intellectuals and revolutionaries of that time.
He was expressing through music what H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael and the Black Panthers and Huey Newton
were saying with their words, what the Last Poets and Amiri Baraka were saying in poetry.
He was their torchbearer in jazz, now ahead of me.
He played what they felt inside and were expressing through riots - "burn baby burn" - that
were taking place everywhere in this country during the 1960s.
It was all about revolution for a lot of young black people -
Afro haircuts, dashikis, black power, fists raised in the air.
Coltrane was their symbol, their pride - their beautiful, black, revoulutionary pride.
I had been it a few years back, now he was it, and that was cool with me.
```
[Separate paragraph.]
```
It was this way for many intellectual and revolutionary whites and Asians as well.
Even his change to a more spiritual music in the music on A Love Supreme - which was like a prayer - reached
out and influenced those people who were into peace, hippies and people like that.
I heard he played a lot of love-ins, which was becoming the rage all over California for a lot of whites.
So he was reaching different groupsl of people, too.
His music was embraced by a lot of different kinds of people, and that was beautiful and I was proud of him,
even if I liked his earlier music more.
He once told me that even he liked some of the music he did earlier better than what he was doing now.
But Trane was on a search, and his course kept taking him farther and farther out; he couldn't turn back even though I think he wanted to.
```
[Separate paragraph.]
```
His death created chaos in the "free thing" because he was its leader.
He was like Bird to all those musicians who considered themselves "out" - you, know, "free," out in space:
he was like a god to them.
When he died it was much like when Bird died for a lot of bebop musicans who looked to him for directions,
even though he himself had been directionless for a lot of years.
Ornette Coleman was still around, and some turned to him.
But for most Trane had been their guiding light, and after he was gone they seemed to me like people in a
boat in the ocean without compass or paddles.
It seemed a lot of what he stood for musically died with him.
Even though some of his disciples carried on his message, they carried it to smaller and smaller audiences.
```

#### Check Out Some MLK!

To really understand this music requires a knowledge of American History.
The web and your local library give you access to a lot of this information, totally for free.

1. Listen to Alabama and A Love Supreme - right now!
2. Find one or more videos of Martin Luther King's speeches and marches and watch them
3. Listen to Alabama and A Love Supreme again, with these particular forms fresh in your memory

I wager you will never be the same!

### First Four Talking Heads Albums

They were students at RISD so were familiar with abstract art.

- All their songs are very painterly.
- Maybe mention a song from each.

Consider this homework.
I will not go into great detail here - there's too much and you should be able to
figure this out for yourself by now.

#### Talking Heads 77

- Psycho Killer
  - Not about any specific person
  - Associated with Son of Sam because of timing of release
  - Actually written years before that
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_Killer

#### More Songs About Buildings and Food

- For Artists Only

Favorite line: "You can't see it till it's finished!"

Having dabbled in several art forms and can attest that this song is sufficiently abstract that it applies to all of them.

In fact, if there's an art form or just a genre that hasn't appeared yet, I am confident the ideas in this song will still apply.

#### Fear of Music

- I Zimbra
  - an adaptation of Dadaist Hugo Ball's poem "Gadji beri bimba".
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Zimbra

#### Remain in Light

An extremely colorful expansion on themes first explored in I Zimbra.

- Once in a Lifetime
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1wg1DNHbNU
- Abstractions - the lack of particular forms - is one of the things that makes this song so great!

This whole album is so different from their first album, it's truly amazing to hear the progression!

This proves to me that understanding the abstract - freeing yourself from limiting particular forms -
is extremely powerful and hugely beneficial.
