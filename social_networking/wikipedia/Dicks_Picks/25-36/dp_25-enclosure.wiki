==Enclosure==

The release includes two sheets of paper stapled together in the middle, yielding an eight-page enclosure.  The front duplicates the cover of the CD and the back is dark reddish-brown with a slight gradient, that also serves as the background for all of the pages inside.

The first two pages on the inside feature a [[collage]] of three images: a large black-and-white photograph of Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, a small photograph of some sound equipment, and a small, colorful drawing of a three-dimensional checkerboard motif with stars on top and musical notes at the bottom surrounding a red and blue heart with a white lightning bolt in the center.  The middle two pages contain a color photograph by Jim Anderson of the entire band on stage, and the last two pages list the contents of and credits for the release, along with a large black-and-white photo of the band on stage.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 25, &copy; 1978, 2002.</ref>
