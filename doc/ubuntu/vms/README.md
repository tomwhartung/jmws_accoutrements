About our use of Virtual Machines.

## Not Using These VMs

For the reason we are not using the VMs on jane and bette, see:

- `doc/devops/vms/README.md` in this repo, i.e.:
- https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_accoutrements/blob/master/doc/devops/vms/README.md

If it is decided to use one or both of these, the subdirectories contain
information about how they were set up.
