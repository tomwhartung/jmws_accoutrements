# 3-email.md

First step turns out to replace all 120 of the site-based email addresses, such as `products@tomhartung.com`,
that I have been using all these years, to the cloud.

For privacy reasons, I am not keeping any details about all that on github!

# Important Reminder!!

For conversions to work on groja.com, these two environment variables must be set:

- `GROJA_MAIL_FROM` - formerly set to `no_reply@groja.com`
- `GROJA_MAIL_TO` - formerly set to `conversion@groja.com`

**Don't forget!!**
