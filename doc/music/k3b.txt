When ripping, k3b sometimes hangs.  Following are a couple of things to try:

- If the downloaded tags contain a lot of special characters, try removing them -- see Edit Info below
- If a popup dialog says there are other processes using the drive, tell it to kill those processes

Edit Info -- to remove special characters:

- Click on Edit Info and remove all special characters from the album-level tags
- For each track: hightlight then F2 or enter to reduce the name to alphabetical chars only
