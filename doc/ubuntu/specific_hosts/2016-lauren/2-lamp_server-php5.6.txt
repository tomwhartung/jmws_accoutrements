 Get Groja-Joomla LAMP Site Running
====================================
We are using PHP 5.6 on lauren and bette, instead of the VMs.

Ensure Required LAMP Packages Are Installed
-------------------------------------------
None of these LAMP packages are already installed
[ ] Install any of the following packages that are missing:
    Commands (as root):
      dpkg-query -l 'package_name_or_regex'   ## if it's not found, it needs to be installed
                                              ## if nothing displays, it is not installed
      apt-get install -s package_name         ## Simulate installation
      apt-get install -y package_name         ## Do it without requesting confirmation
    Required packages:
      apache2
      apache2-utils

      https://lornajane.net/posts/2016/php-7-0-and-5-6-on-ubuntu
    All references agree that we need to add a ppa to do this
    As root:
      add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
      apt-get update
      apt-get install -y php5.6
    (Try to) install these packages, an edited version of the list of packages from the first reference:
      (http://askubuntu.com/questions/761713/how-can-i-downgrade-from-php-7-to-php-5-6-on-ubuntu-16-04)
    As root:

      apt-get install php5.6-xml             # Installed OK
      apt-get install php5.6-xmlrpc          # Installed OK
[ ] Check php version currently being run on the command line on groja1:
      php -v   # PHP 7.0.8-0ubuntu0.16.04.3 (cli) ( NTS )
[ ] Check php version currently being used by apache on groja1:
    As tomh on groja1:
      # Put a copy phpinfo.php in /var/www/html/
    Access in browser:
      http://groja1/phpinfo.php
    Find the php version being used in the page
      PHP Version 7.0.8-0ubuntu0.16.04.3
[ ] Set php5.6 as the default for both apache and cli:
    As root:
      # For php in web apps
      a2dismod php7.0
      a2enmod php5.6
      service apache2 restart
      # For php-cli in the command line
      sudo ln -sfn /usr/bin/php5.6 /etc/alternatives/php
[ ] Re-check php version currently being run on the command line on groja1:
      php -v  # PHP 5.6.30-12~ubuntu16.04.1+deb.sury.org+1 (cli)
[ ] Re-check php version currently being used by apache on groja1:
    As tomh on groja1:
      # Put a copy phpinfo.php in /var/www/html/
    Access in browser:
      http://lauren/phpinfo.php
    Find the php version being used in the page:
      PHP 5.6.30-12~ubuntu16.04.1+deb.sury.org+1
[ ] Optional: to set php7.0 as the default for both apache and cli:
    *** Not doing this ***

Populate /var/www
-----------------
[ ] Get the seeourminds.com websites' source files in /var/www
    As tomh:
      Create tar file on groja1
      Copy to lauren
   On lauren
      cd /var/www
      mkdir unpack
      cp seeourminds.com-from_vms-2017_07_03.tgz unpack/
      cd unpack/
      tar -xvzf seeourminds.com-from_vms-2017_07_03.tgz
      rm seeourminds.com-from_vms-2017_07_03.tgz
      mv seeourminds.com groja-joomla.com
      mv groja-joomla.com ..
      cd ..
      rmdir unpack/
      l
      cd groja-joomla.com/
      l

Disk Space Spotcheck
--------------------
[ ] Disk Space Spotcheck:
    /: 5.2G/82G (7%)

Configure Apache
----------------
[ ] Copy version of 050-seeourminds.com.conf from VM into /etc/apache2/sites-available
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l *.conf   ## "Installed version"
      cp ~tomh/tmp/050-seeourminds.com.conf .
      mv 050-seeourminds.com.conf 020-groja.com.conf
      ci -l 020-groja.com.conf   ## "Copied from vm groja1"
    Fix ServerAlias specifications in apache2/sites-available/*.conf files
    As root:
      ci -l 020-groja.com.conf   ## "Copied from vm groja1 and updated for this host"
[ ] Enable mod_rewrite and php, and start apache2 (as root):
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2
      ls -al mods-*/rewrite*
      ls -al mods-*/php*
      ls -al mods-*/mpm*
    If not enabled (or disabled, as in the case of mpm_event),
      run one or more of these commands as appropriate:
    As root:
      a2enmod rewrite
      a2dismod mpm_event    ## mpm_event must be DIS-abled
      a2enmod mpm_prefork

Finding the Right Copy of the Database
--------------------------------------
[ ] Databases used on the VM:
    Use a backup of the seeourminds.com db:
      Try using current db from lauren:
        seeourminds.com-2016_09_27-lauren.sql.gz
      If that doesn't work, try using current db from bette:
        seeourminds.com-2016_09_27-bette.sql.gz
[ ] Create user and db:
    See ~/technical/cmses/joomla/sql/create_user_dbs-seeourminds.sql
    As tomh:
      ms
      create user ...
      create database ...
      grant all on ...
[ ] Restore db:
    As tomh:
      rs -h lauren -d 2016_07_16 sm
      rs -h bette -d 2016_07_16 sm    ## if that doesn't work
[ ] seeourminds.com
    As root:
      a2ensite 050-seeourminds.com.conf
      service apache2 stop
      service apache2 start
      l sites*/*.conf
    Should see the sites-available/020-groja.com.conf file linked to
      the sites-enabled directory

Checking the Site:
------------------
[ ] Access in browser:
      http://groja1.seeourminds.com

Copy/Back Up
------------
This is why we quit using the VM: so we could use normal backup and restore scripts!

Final Steps
-----------
[ ] Use logrotate to rotate apache logs weekly
    Reference:
      https://serversforhackers.com/managing-logs-with-logrotate
    Ensure logrotate is installed:
      sudo dpkg-query --list '*rotate*'
    Check installed version of the logrotate conf file for apache into RCS
    As root:
      cd /etc/logrotate.d
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l apache2    ## "Installed version"
    Edit the config file as desired
      sudo vi /etc/logrotate.d/apache2
    This time we are changing it to rotate them weekly and keep a year's worth:
      "daily" -> "weekly"
      "rotate 14" -> "rotate 52"
    and adding these lines to use dates for the log file name extensions (instead of .1, .2, etc.):
      dateext
      dateformat -%Y-%m-%d
