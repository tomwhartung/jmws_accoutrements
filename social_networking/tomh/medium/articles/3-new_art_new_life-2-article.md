I intend to eventually publish this at: https://medium.com/@tomwhartung .

"Eventually."

# Goal - The Big Picture

To be able to reference this article in a subsequent article about my vision, and then
able to reference *that* article (about my vision) in a *subsequent* article about the
goals and reasons for creating seeourminds.com .

# Ideas

## Songs

I sometimes like to put Easter-eggy-type links to songs in my articles.  It's a thing.

- What's So Funny 'Bout Peace Love and Understanding
- Love Is All You Need
- Love Is All Is Alright (High Universal Morality)

## My Point

I like Mondrian's idealism and want to contribute to the awareness of the need for more
equlibrium and desire for equivalent relationships.

Or something like that.

## My Take

### Ideas I Like:

- Equilibrium in general
- Equivalent mutual relationships in particular
- Purified forms - in art, people, and society
- Learning about and revealing inner traits and energies
- Honesty

### Parallels With Archetypes

- Breaking things down into essential elements (N/S and F/T) so that we can see them
- Removing distracting surface shit

### Obvious but Important

One can't create the same sort art that Mondrian created, for that would not be art.

# The Article

## Title

The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian

## Body - New

### ("Cold" Introduction)

Piet Mondrian completed his final book, *The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships,*
in 1931, but by then had been working on it since at least 1921.
It is short but profound and abstract - so much so that
[The Collected Works of Piet Mondrian,](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Art-Life-Collected-Twentieth-Century/dp/0306805081)
published in 1987, bears the same title.

Mondrian believed that art and life follow similar paths:
> In life every sincere effort leads to human evolution, and it is the same in art.  Rightly seen, there remains *a single path of evolution* that, regardless of time, *is identical for life and for art.*

He also believed the path that art and life follow is one of purification and equilibrium of opposites:
> If art is an expression of life and anticipates it, we can state that the new life is *the culture of equivalent relationships.*  Just as with the plastic means in art, it is evident that for this life our mentality must become more or less purified, not in an old-fashioned puritanical way, but so as to rise above the oppression of limiting, particular forms.  Thus in the same way as art, life reaches a state of real equilibrium *through pure and equivalent relationships of increasingly free individuals.*

How and why did Mondrian develop his distinctive style, and what are the implications of it for us today and in the future?
This article seeks to answer those questions!

### Introducing Piet Mondrian

### The Power of Abstractions

#### Abstractions in Math and Science

Formulas - V = IR (Ohm's law) - describes the flow of electrons in everything electronic, from the 12 volts of direct current in cars, to
the 220 volts of alternating current in heavy appliances like air conditioners, washers and driers, to the
micro electronics in our smart phones and key fobs.

#### Abstractions in Art

Literature, poetry and music - anything with similies and metaphors - All Along the Watchtower ....
Dance - ballet - story abstracted to its essential elements and retold using the movements permitted by the dance.

[Business - organizational chart - (do I want this here, or in a separate section, or maybe just skip it?)]
[Even terms like bread, man, woman, dog, cat are abstractions in that they are only concepts unless they are qualified (e.g., my cat).]

#### Abstractions in Politics

- Countries: Declaration of Independence, 
- Political Parties: Statement of Principles
- Manifestos

Assassinations can be "tricky," because they can turn popular leaders into martyrs.
It's much more difficult to kill an idea - an abstraction - than it is to kill a person.

#### Abstractions in Religion

One might say that gods are the ultimate abstractions.

#### BYO Specifics

Abstractions ....

### The Power of Intuition

[Abstracting processes - ideas: installing software, vacuuming, ???]

Subconscious processing - the "aha" we get when driving, mowing the lawn, washing dishes, taking a shower, etc.

### The New Art - The New Life

My main point and where we quote and explain only the best quotes....

### (Possible) Conclusion

This short book was not published during his lifetime.
I believe this is because he was so far ahead of his time.
It is also so abstract that it is difficult to understand - even for me, and I love abstract stuff!

## Body - Old (To Be Deleted)

In 1911, the Dutch painter [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) (1876-1944) moved from The Netherlands to Paris.
He soon began contributing to the
[De Stijl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl) - Dutch for "The Style" - art movement.

Mondrian started out painting representational, "particular" paintings of such things as trees and landscapes.
His paintings gradually became more and more abstract until all representation was "annihilated."

Reduced to only the essential elements, his later work consisted of images
containing black perpendicular lines and rectangles painted in primary colors on a white background.
He called this type of painting "Pure Neo-Plasticism" and the goal of his paintings was to
compose these essential elements so that these opposites of color and form would exist in equilibrium.

It looks easy to create these compositions, but it is not!

I have learned through experience that changing one of his paintings - his Composition With Red, Blue, and Yellow,
for example - even slightly destroys the image’s equilibrium.
For proof, see the gallery of experimental “Mondrianesque Compositions” at seeourminds.com.

The evolution in his paintings is interesting, but his writings - which explain his
perceptions and reasons for painting like this, are fascinating.

## The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships

Mondrian completed his final book
[The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Art-Life-Collected-Twentieth-Century/dp/0306805081)
in 1931, but by then had been working on it since at least 1921.
That may not quite be 100 years ago, but it's close enough.

In this book he claims that just as art has evolved into a composition containing opposites of form and color in equilibrium,
so will future society.
Following is a quote from the book's Introduction, written by Mondrian in 1932:

> The culture of art demonstrates that only *man's development* in the distant future can create universal equilibrium through the *establishment of equivalent relationships.* These relationships are already realized in pure art - art free from figuration and all limiting form - expressing the beauty of equivalent relationships exclusively through pure line and color.  This art is an image of the ideal human goal toward which humanity is moving.

Are we here today any closer to the goal of living in universal equilibrium than Mondrian was 100 years ago?
Join me in taking a look at some more quotes from this book and see if we can answer that question!

# Annotated Quotes

## Introduction to The New Art - The New Life (1932)

- Was going to use this quote in the old version, but not sure whether we want to use it in the new.

> The culture of art demonstrates that only *man's development* in the distant future can create
> universal equilibrium through the *establishment of equivalent relationships.*
> These relationships are already realized in pure art - art free from figuration and all limiting form - expressing the
> beauty of equivalent relationships exclusively through pure line and color.
> This art is an image of the ideal human goal toward which humanity is moving.
(p. 278)


## The New Art - The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships (1931)

Written over a period of three years, based on ideas developed over the previous decade, but never published during his lifetime.

*All emphasis is in the original.*


- **Opposites and the Importance of Equilibrium**
- **Purified Forms**
- **Equivalent Mutual Relationships**
- Equilibrium - not quite "harmony" - He addresses this specifically; look it up in the book!  It's around this place, p.252.
Mutual Respect: I believe he is talking about this when he talks about equilibrated relationships.
For me, it is easier for me to define what equilibrium is *not* - for example, the images in
my experimental "Mondrianesque" gallery - than to define what it *is.*
The increasingly wide gap between rich and poor certainly belies a huge amount of disequilibrium.
Disequilibrium is likewise apparent in the entire range of abusive relationships, from mansplaining to spousal murder.
I suppose it is a sad fact of either my pessimistic outlook on life - or simply life itself - that I cannot
think of a good example of equilibrium outside of Mondrian's paintings, of course.
> However, even in the new aesthetic, the word "equilibrium" has caused many misunderstandings and repeated errors.
> The only way to correct them will be by attentive study of the plastic expression of the new art.
> It will be seen that the equilibrium in the new art is not a static state without action, as is generally thought but,
> on the contrary, *a continuous and mutually annihilating opposition of equivalent but unequal elements.*
(p. 252)


- **General/Best**
- **Opposites and the Importance of Equilibrium**
- **Purified Forms**
- Oppositions other than the natural action of breathing in and out exist in the daily lives of everyone.
Significantly, the psychological oppositions of judging and perceiving, thinking and feeling, etc. that Jung identified
in his General Description of the Types are prime examples!
> By following the rhythm of the two contrary oppositions of the straight line, we can say
> that the real life basic to man is simply the action of equilibrated opposition - for example,
> the double movement of respiration, which is contrary and complementary.
> It is a pure expression of vital rhythm....

- Too few people are aware of the true significance of Jung's pairs of psychological opposites.
Is there anyone else on the planet who can see the value of working towards equivalence of these fundamental oppositions?
**This is the core of what I am working to express in the SeeOurMinds.com site: the desire to live a "truly human life."**
The internet should help me find them!
> When we understand the equivalence of contrary oppositions of art's rhythm, we work more consciously to build truly human life.
> For least attention is given to establishing equilibrium through *equivalence of the two fundamental oppositions.*

> For instance, aristocratic limitations are re-created under democratic forms, and "socialism" often proves
> synonymous with bourgeoisie.
> And with regard to equivalence, we can say that modern man, although cultivated and refined,
> despite his spiritual improvement is not of really new mentality if he fails to seek equivalence.

> If life and art demonstrate that evolution takes place through the action of creation and abolition,

> But we generally see only one or the other of these two actions: thus life is seen either as declining or as unchanging.

> But those who see both actions as reciprocal understand life as *eternal growth.*

- **High Universal Morality**
> The more human progress asserts itself, the more violently does natural instinct fight against it.
> For progress involves *diminishing the privileges of the natural state.*

> This explains the present hostility to all manifestations of progress and the reactionary efforts in art and in life.
>
> These arise from a narrow conception, from a failure to see clearly.  One does not see the improvement progress brings.

> establish a mutual organization that prevents disequilibrium and constrains man to be just in his social relationships.*
>
> By transforming social organization, we transform the individual.
> Those who attempt to oppose the new order will nevertheless be obliged to follow it.
> There will be nothing despotic in this constraint.
> And in a probably distant future, order will be imposed only by *mutual necessity.*

- This is a good quote to support using spiritual portraits for transparency and better relationships:
> Love and friendship play an important role in mutual nonequivalent exchange.
> The new art demonstrates that in order to achieve real equivalence the oppositions of a relationship must be pure.
> To become pure they must first be separated, that is, disengaged from whatever they are confounded with.
>
> When the two aspects of life are confounded, hypocrisy controls and betrays us.
> This is why it is enormously important for the new art to establish *purified forms and pure relationships:
> they do not conceal, they are real and show themselves for what they are.*
