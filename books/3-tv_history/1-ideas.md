Ideas for third ebook:

- Trace evolution of personalities on top TV shows from 1950-2000

# Core Idea

Show how personalities in TV shows have evolved from having a
few very superficial and stereotypical characters in the 1950s into having
bigger casts with weirdows in the 1990s.

# Target Audience

- 1. People new to writing fiction, e.g., ebooks
- 2. Writers looking for a framework in which to view thier characters
- 3. Anyone interested in seeing how characters on TV have evolved

# Shows to Use

Maybe it would be best to try a gradual approach.

- Volume 1: use shows I already have images for:
  - 1951-1957: I Love Lucy (4) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Lucy
  - 1966-1969: Star Trek TOS (10) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series
  - ???1972-1983: M*A*S*H - part 1??? - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)#Main_character_timeline
  - 1982-1993: Cheers (10) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheers
  - 1990-1991: Twin Peaks (25) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks
  - 1993-2002: X-Files (2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files
  - 1999-2007: The Sopranos (6) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos
- Volume 2: use shows I want to develop images for:
  - 1955-1975: Gunsmoke - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunsmoke#Television_series_(1955%E2%80%931975)
  - ???1972-1983: M*A*S*H - part 2??? - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M*A*S*H_(TV_series)#Main_character_timeline
  - 1989-1998: Seinfeld - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld

Looking further forward, if I can sell these:

- Volume 3 or 4: use shows from 2000+?
- Volume 3 or 4: use shows I find to fill in the gaps?
- Deluxe Volume: combine all smaller volumes into a deluxe volume?
