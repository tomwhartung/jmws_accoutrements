 Target Market and Services to Offer
=====================================
Ideas that have been rolling around in my head for the past few weeks/months/years even

Targeting
---------
o (Early stage) Startups
  Seems like early stage startups are more likely to be able to use generalists
  "First consultation free"
o Small businesses
  "Small projects for small businesses"

Services
--------
Currently feel qualified to offer:
o General free-lancing: LAMP, CMS, Java
  No project too small (smaller projects preferred)
o Device Detection in LAMP CMSes (e.g., targeting ads)
o De-mystify technology and jargon
o CMS selection
o Training
o Documentation
Would like to be able to offer: (apply for business loan for initial funding??)
o Research IoT Ideas
o Simple watch apps (e.g., background)
  Think this would be easy, but
  Would need some sort of loan to buy watch(es?)

Freemium Offers
---------------
o Free: 1 hour meeting to discuss your situation
o E-books: there is a separate file for these

More Startupy Idea(s)

Are any of these ideas feasible?

More General Fishing-Type Questions
-----------------------------------
Q.1 Do any of these seem feasible?
Q.1 How to prioritize?
Q.3 Will it turn people off if I offer too many services?

A generalist who is willing to do short projects of most any nature - seems to me like it could be a thing I could do, and enjoy doing.
