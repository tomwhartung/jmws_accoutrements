Putting off upgrading jane, barbara, and ava for now.

- Table of Ubuntu Versions:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#Table_of_versions
- Important Points:
  - 16.04 LTS is supported until 2021-04-01 - so upgrading these is not urgent
  - 18.04 LTS is supported until 2028-04-01 - so we will need to upgrade eventually
- Release Notes:
  - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes


## How to Upgrade

This link shows how to upgrade **both** desktop and **server**

- https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes#Upgrading_from_Ubuntu_16.04_LTS_or_17.10

### Upgrading vs. Starting From Scratch

This process seems to be quite a bit easier than always starting from scratch:

- No need to burn and waste another CD/DVD
- No need to partion disks
- No need to reinstall my favorite programs


## No Rush

So far, bette and lauren seem to be running ok.
