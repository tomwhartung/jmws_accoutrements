# jmws_accoutrements

Repo for JooMooWebSites documentation, scripts, presentations, and other files that can help us when working with Jmws code, but are not CMS-specific, and in most cases not even "deliverables."

* bin/ contains some database backup and restore and afew scripts I use for deployment
* doc/ contains some simple documentation for devops and processes, and the popular cmses drupal, joomla, and wordpress
* presentations/ contains slides etc. for some presentations I've done

Although these accoutrements are intended for my personal use, I am sharing them in the hopes that you may find them useful in your own work.

Because many of these are works in progress, some of them may not be very documented.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
