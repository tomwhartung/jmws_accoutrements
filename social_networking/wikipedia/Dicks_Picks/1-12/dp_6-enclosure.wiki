==Enclosure==
Included with the release is a single sheet folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure about the size of the CD case. The front of this enclosure duplicates the cover of the CD and the back contains a black-and-white photograph of a ticket stub for the event.  The two pages inside contain a wide black-and-white photograph of the band.  Above this photograph, on the left side, is a list of the band's members, and on the right side, is a listing of the tracks along with credits and copyright information.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 6, 1996.</ref>
