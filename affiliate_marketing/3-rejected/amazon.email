Hello, 

We’ve now reviewed your application to the Associates Program. Unfortunately, it did not meet our program requirements. As a result, we have closed the account under which you had been temporarily approved. 

Why? 
Your Site http://groja.com, http://seeourminds.co and http://tomwhartung.com did not meet our content standards, which can be found here: &#60;https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/node/topic/GTYGNH75279SL9HY&#62;, in that you did not have sufficient content or the content on your site was not original. 

What’s next? 
You will be paid for any outstanding fees accrued prior to this notice. You’re welcome to reapply once our program requirements are met. Thank you for your interest in the Associates Program.
