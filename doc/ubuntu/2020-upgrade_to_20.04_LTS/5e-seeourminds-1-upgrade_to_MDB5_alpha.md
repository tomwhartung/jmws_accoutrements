# Upgrade to MDB5

For hints about how to do this, see `6-mdb5_tips_and_tricks.md`.

## Choose: Download or Use MDB CLI

The MDB CLI files have a more recent date:

- Mdb cli: 7/30
- Downloaded: 7/20

### Comparing File Listings

Comparing lists of downloaded files to those from MDB CLI:

```

```

The mdb-cli files could indeed be a bit more up-to-date, and it makes sense that the download file could lag behind it.

### `.mdb` Hidden File

Not shown above, the mdb-cli files include a hidden file:

```
$ cat mdb-cli/MDB5-Free/.mdb
{
  "packageName": "MDB5-Free"
}$
```

Presumably I can use the mdb cli to updates these at some future time.

### Using the Mdb Cli Files

It looks like it would be best to use the mdb cli files.

## Copy in Code

### Save Current Versions in `*-old` Directories

This makes it easy to grab the few custom files I have created as they are needed.

```
g mv  README.md  README-seeourminds.md
gc 'Renaming README.md to README-seeourminds.md .'
g mv README-MDB.txt README.txt
gc 'Renaming README-MDB.txt to README.txt , so it will be overwritten by the new version from MDB, if indeed there are changes.'
l
g mv css css-old , to save a copy of the old files.'
gc 'Renaming css to css-old , to save a copy of the old files, at least until I get the site working well with MDB5.'
g mv js js-old
gc 'Renaming js to js-old , to save a copy of the old files, at least until I get the site working well with MDB5.'
```

I shouldn't have to use these files, but it's nice to have them close by, in case I run into issues.

### Copy in the MDB CLI Files

Copy in the new files generated by running mdb cli.

```
l /var/www/seeourminds.com/htdocs/seeourminds.com/mdb-cli/MDB5-Free/
mv  /var/www/seeourminds.com/htdocs/seeourminds.com/mdb-cli/MDB5-Free/.mdb .
ga .mdb
gc 'Adding hidden file static/content/.mdb , which was created by mdb cli.'
rm -fr img/
gc 'Deleted everything in the static/content/img directory because it is no longer needed by MDB5.'
ga  index-mdb5_template.html
gc 'Adding index-mdb5_template.html , which shows the tags I need to use in the django base.html template.'
l /var/www/seeourminds.com/htdocs/seeourminds.com/mdb-cli/MDB5-Free/
mv  /var/www/seeourminds.com/htdocs/seeourminds.com/mdb-cli/MDB5-Free/License.pdf  /var/www/seeourminds.com/htdocs/seeourminds.com/mdb-cli/MDB5-Free/README.txt  /var/www/seeourminds.com/htdocs/seeourminds.com/mdb-cli/MDB5-Free/css  /var/www/seeourminds.com/htdocs/seeourminds.com/mdb-cli/MDB5-Free/js  /var/www/seeourminds.com/htdocs/seeourminds.com/mdb-cli/MDB5-Free/src/ .
g rm static/content/License-MDB.pdf
gc 'Removing static/content/License-MDB.pdf because it is an obsolete MDB4 file.'
ga static/content/License.pdf
gc 'Adding the new MDB5 license file as static/content/License.pdf .'
ga static/content/README.txt
gc 'Adding the new MDB5 README.txt file as static/content/README.txt .'
ga static/content/css
gc 'Adding the new MDB5 css files in static/content/css .'
ga static/content/js
gc 'Adding the new MDB5 js files in static/content/js .'
ga static/content/src/
gc 'Adding the MDB5 src files in static/content/src/ .'
```

## Update the Django `base.html` Template

Using `static/content/index-mdb5_template.html` as a model, update the `templates/content/base.html` template.
