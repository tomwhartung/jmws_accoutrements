 Obstacles That Must Be Overcome
=================================

Internal
--------
Mindset - very used to relying on recruiters to get me interviews and the job
Self-esteem - related to mindset; jobsearch frustrations take their toll with this!

External
--------
Money - was assuming that after my Device Detection + LAMP CMSes experiment I would find a new job
