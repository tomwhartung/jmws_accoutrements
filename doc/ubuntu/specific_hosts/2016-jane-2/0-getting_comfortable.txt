 Getting Comfortable
=====================
Install the basic stuff we need to get around and do the other stuff.

This is the process we are running to set up jane.
--------------------------------------------------
Parts of it should be perfectly usable on other hosts.
Trying to make this more of a command line process, so we can identify
the essentials and get them set up, making getting other stuff done easier
