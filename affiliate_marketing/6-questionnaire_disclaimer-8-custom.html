<h2>Disclaimer: Limitations of Psychological Self-Tests and Screening Quizzes</h2>
<p>From https://counsellingresource.com/quizzes/testing-disclaimer/</p>
<p>The screening tests and other psychological self-tests provided at this site are intended for educational purposes only and should not be understood to constitute any type of diagnosis or healthcare recommendation.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer and Our Views on Psychological Testing</h3>
<p>Our quizzes are intended to be fun and educational, and they may help increase your awareness of particular experiences or of particular forms of psychological distress. They are not by themselves tools for diagnosing any type of health or mental health condition.</p>
<p>Psychological tests and quizzes at CounsellingResource.com should not be understood as providing any type of diagnosis or healthcare recommendation.</p>
<p>In the view of this site, self-administered psychological screening tests may help to enhance self-awareness of one’s own experiences, but cannot give any well-informed recommendation about what should be done about those experiences. In other words, by asking about particular experiences, a psychological test may simply help highlight elements of those experiences. Having those experiences highlighted may offer you an opportunity to reflect on them at greater length, or to consider their relevance in a broader life context. What any individual chooses to do — or ‘should’ choose to do — with the results of any given test, is a matter for the individual and should not be dictated by the test itself.</p>

<h3>More Information on Protecting Your Privacy</h3>
<p>For further information about how this site protects your privacy and confidentiality with respect to psychological self tests, please see our note “Psychological Self-Tests and Your Privacy”.</p>

<h3>More Information on Psychological Distress, Counselling and Psychotherapy</h3>
<p>For further information about diagnostic criteria for some of the forms of psychological distress which these screening tests address, please check the Mental Health Reference site.</p>
<p>Our section “About Counselling and Psychotherapy”, as well as our online therapy information (“Online Therapy and Online Counselling”), can answer many of the questions you might have about seeking counselling or therapy.</p>
