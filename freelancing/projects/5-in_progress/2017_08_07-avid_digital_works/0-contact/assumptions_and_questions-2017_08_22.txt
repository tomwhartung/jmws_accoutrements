Talked to Tonya and got some background and goals.
For details, see blue Mead "Project Notes" notebook (i.e., notes taken on this date).

Important!  Want to sell services described here:

 Assumptions
=============

- Most of these articles should be objective (like wikipedia)
  - I.e., no attepts to market or sell anything
  - Possible exceptions: 6, 12, 13, 14?, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23,24


 Questions
===========

Who created this list of topics?

Is the list prioritized in any way?

Do they want all of these ASAP or maybe one per week or ...?

Should I supply markup: headings, links, and/or images?

The same outline can be used for all three of these:
1. Self-Storage Security Systems
17. Residential Security & Fire Alarm Systems
18. Commercial Security & Fire Alarm Systems

I am thinking I should give you an introductory special:
these three articles, which will admittedly be very similar,
for $0.10/word.

If that's cool, I will write up a short contract for the work.
