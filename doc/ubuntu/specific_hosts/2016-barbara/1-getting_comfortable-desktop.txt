 Getting Comfortable
=====================
Install the basic stuff we need to get around and do the other stuff.

This is the process we ran to set up barbara.
---------------------------------------------
It is ok to use it as a guide to set up other hosts.

 Install Essential System Tools:
---------------------------------
[ ] Update system, reboot
    Repeat as necessary
[ ] Install unity-tmeak-tool
    apt-get install unity-tweak-tool
[ ] Install rcs, synaptic, vim, openssh-server
[ ] Install subversion, git, git-svn, (??git-stuff, git-magic??)
[ ] Install fortune-mod, fortunes, other fortune* packages as desired
[ ] Install xscreensaver, xscreensaver-data-extra
[ ] Install xscreensaver-gl-extra
[ ] Lock xscreensaver and unity-tweak-tool to launcher
[ ] Remove gnome-screensaver
    apt-get update
    apt list gnome-screensaver
    apt-get remove gnome-screensaver
[ ] Add xscreensaver to startup programs
    gnome-session-properties
[ ] Update System Settings -> Brightness & Lock
[ ] Update System Settings -> Power
[ ] Update Terminal Preferences
[ ] Check man page for other steps needed to get it working at startup
    man xscreensaver

[ ] Set up root and tomh accounts:
    Copy to thumb drive then to barbara:
    .bashrc, links to .bash_aliases*
[ ] Set preferences, lock terminal and firefox to launcher
[ ] Set terminal double-click word boundary preferences
    Either: Edit -> Profile Preferences -> General -> Select by word characters
    Or: use dconf command, e.g.:
       dconf write /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:b1dcc9dd-5262-4d8d-a863-c897e6d979b9/word-char-exceptions '@ms "?_+~Â·:"'

[ ] Copy /etc/hosts from another host and setup static IP
[ ] Check /etc/hosts and /etc/fstab into RCS
    Disk Space Spotcheck - / and /home - ensure we have enough

[ ] Install chrome and chromium-browser
    Found chromium-browser in synaptic
    Download the .deb file for chrome and install by double-clicking on it.
    http://google.com/chrome
[ ] Disable annoying popup asking for password to unlock keyring
    When the popup appears, click on Continue (as I recall?) without entering a password.
    When the next popup appears (some sort of warning, as I recall) - click OK
[ ] Lock chrome and chromium browser to launcher

[ ] System Settings -> Automatically check for updates -> Every two weeks
[ ] System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts
    Update shortcut for switching between workspaces

[ ] Disk Space Spotcheck:
      /: 4.2G/13G (35%)
      /home: 0.5G/9G (6%)
      /var/www: 5.6G/10G (59%)

[ ] Find screenshot (app) in Ubuntu Software (already installed?)
[ ] Lock screenshot and disks [manager] to launcher
[ ] Confirm installation of image viewer xeyes (pre-installed??),
