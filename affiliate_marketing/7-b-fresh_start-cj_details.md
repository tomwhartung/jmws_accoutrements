# CJ Affiliate - Details

- Focus on using Barnes & Noble links from CJ Affiliate - assuming that's possible

## Network Profile

I need to fill out a short form.

### General

> "Describe your business model"

Description:

> My content is unique: I draw images of personalities.  The people may
> be real or fictional, and many are based on books, frequently biographies,
> and dvds, frequently popular series with ensemble casts and occasionally
> movies.  By writing stories about the images that highlight psychological
> patterns, such as opposites attract, I can draw parallels between real
> people and fictional characters - for example, Franklin and Eleanor
> Roosevelt, and Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the X-Files.
> This increases people's curiosity, ideally prompting them to buy books and
> dvds to learn more about the characters and underlying psychology.

### Promotional Methods

> "Select at least one of the following"

Methods: Checking "Content / Niche:"

> Select this option if your business model is based on content, such as
> news stories, personal stories, images, media, music, or video.  Content
> sites and bloggers present original content that attracts audiences
> with shared interests.

### Response:

When I submitted the form - on Thursday 2019-01-31 - this appeared in a pop-up window:

> Important: Your joined advertisers have 14 days to review your Promotional Method(s).

> Content / Niche

> Click OK to confirm:

> - The modification to your Promotional Method(s) is correct.

> - You will not use the new Promotional Method(s) until the 14-day review has been completed.

> - You will review/edit your Network Profile now to ensure it still accurately describes your business model.

**So I need to wait until Valentine's Day before using any links**
