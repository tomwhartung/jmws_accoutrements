Continuing to totally changing everything about tomwhartung.com even after moving it to the new server.

# Use MDB5

Use django and Material Design Bootstrap - MDB5.

- [ ] Consider these two options to start:
    - [ ] Use existing download -- or download fresh MDB5 starter kit
    - [ ] OR - maybe try using MDB CLI to create an initial template?
        - [ ] If there are issues, check the version of node and maybe try upgrading to a newer version
            - See `5d-groja-2-upgrade_to_MDB5_alpha.md` for details about the node, npm, and MDB CLI installation on ava
        - [ ] Does MDB CLI provide additional options for starting fresh?

I am just curious about the differences, if any.
And I suspect both techniques will yield the same, or at least very similar, results.

Note: it is not worth diving deep into these options because I'm really just curious.

# Content Updates

## Strive for Having Minimal Content

If there's to be a blog, keep it minimal, and use just json, not a db.

### Menu Structure

Ideas for a starting point:

- [ ] Home
    - Focal point should be a recent photo
    - Keep it minimal!
- [ ] Blog
    - Focus on the FFM
    - This is the **only** site where it is appropriate to discuss the FFM!
- [ ] Products - open a new window to the joomoowebsites.com home page
- [ ] Contact - open a new window to the conversion page at groja.com

This is something I will need to think about.

### New Ideas

- Strive for having a minimalist blog
  - Once created, I typically never update those things
  - There will be new content on the other sites, e.g., seeourminds.com
- First idea:
  - BRIEFLY explain how fractals are the perfect way to display FFM personality traits
- One idea
  - Single post explaining each of these:
    - Characterologist
    - Programmer
    - Writer
    - Artist
  - Why these appeal to me based on my FFM traits
  - BRIEFLY: how I have been each of these all my life
- Another idea:
  - The Good: why my personality makes me well-suited for drawing personalities
  - The Bad: why my personality makes me ill-suited for social networking
  - The Ugly: why I will need to use social networking to get people to understand my art
  - Maybe do each idea in a single article?
- Yet another idea:
  -
- Also:
  - Link to Medium articles

## Original Ideas - Deprecated

The problem with these ideas is, this is exactly the content I want on joomoowebsites.com ,
and it's silly to have two sites with the same content.

Update site to contain:

- List of my spiritual portrait books
- List of my spiritual portrait sites
- List of social networking sites where I post spiritual portraits
- Call for help with sales
  - Maybe dedicate a page to this: I am no salesman, can offer commision only, etc.
