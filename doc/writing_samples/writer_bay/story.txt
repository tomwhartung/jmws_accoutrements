Given the prompt "The horse came back alone," the task was to write a 100-150 word story in 15 minutes.

Following is the story I wrote:

[The horse came back alone] from the trip into the wilderness.  Traveling into Indian country was risky, but he was determined to learn whether the stories of a Fountain of Youth were true.

After all, he was getting older - at 60, few of his contemporaries were still alive - so he felt there was nothing to lose.  He had heard rumors of the fountain throughout his life, and had tracked the most likely location for the spring to central Florida, near present-day Orlando.

One morning, he decided to go in search of it.  He was up before dawn, had some breakfast, saddled his horse, and was following the trail as the sun crested the horizon.

He was never seen again.

Whether he found the fountain or met his maker, no one will ever know.  The only thing known for sure, is he died in pursuit of his life-long dream.
