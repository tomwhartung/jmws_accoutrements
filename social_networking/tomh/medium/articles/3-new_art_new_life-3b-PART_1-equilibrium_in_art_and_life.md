After giving it some thought, I have decided to write a series of articles, focusing the first of them on Mondrian's notion of equilibrium.

# Ultimate Goal of This Article

To be able to reference this article in a subsequent article about my vision.

This is the first part in an series of occasional articles about why Piet Mondrian went from painting
[representational images]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(arts) ) to painting
[abstract images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art).
His writings reveal his reasons for this progression.  These writings are profound and enlightening, but can be difficult to understand.

This article focuses on the parallels he saw between the evolution of his art and the progress of culture and life itself.
Subsequent articles will be about some of the other ideas - such as equilibrium, liberation, and high
universal morality - described in his writings.

### Pieter Cornelis “Piet” Mondriaan

[Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) was born to Johanna Christina de Kok and Pieter Cornelis Mondriaan sr.
in 1872, in the town of [Amersfoort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amersfoort) in the
[Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands).  He started painting at an early age and in 1892 entered the
[Academy for Fine Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksakademie_van_beeldende_kunsten) in
[Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam).

Mondrian's early works were representational - landscapes containing fields, rivers, windmills, and the like.
His Evening; Red Tree (Avond; De rode boom) from 1908–1910 and the 1909 painting View from the Dunes with Beach and Piers, Domburg are
examples of his work at this time.

### Theosophism, Cubism, and De Stijl

He joined the [Theosophical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophical_Society) in 1909.
[Theosophists](https://www.theosophical.org/) "encourage open-minded inquiry into world religions, philosophy, science, and the
arts in order to understand the wisdom of the ages, respect the unity of all life, and help people explore spiritual self-transformation."

One could say theosophists taught themselves how to "think outside the box" long before it was even a thing, much less cool.

The 1910s were transformative for Mondrian.  It is fascinating to view his paintings during this period
[in chronological order](http://www.abcgallery.com/M/mondrian/mondrian.html).

It was during this time that he - using terms from his writings - abandoned "particular forms" completely.
By 1919 his paintings became so abstract that all representation was “annihilated.”

His work [from 1910 through 1914](http://www.abcgallery.com/M/mondrian/mondrian-2.html) shows how his representative works became more
and more geometric until they were totally abstract.  Some of his paintings - such as Still Life With Gingerpot I and
Still Life With Gingerpot II - show a trend towards the [Cubist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism) style for which artists such as
[Georges Braque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Braque)
and [Pablo Picasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso) are most well-known.

World War I raged from 1914-1918 in other parts of Europe, but the
[Netherlands was](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/189936/the-netherlands-are-vs-the-netherlands-is) neutral.
It was during the war, in 1917, that Mondrian joined several other painters and architects there in founding an art movement called
[De Stijl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl) - Dutch for "The Style."

And it was during this time, [from 1916 through 1921](http://www.abcgallery.com/M/mondrian/mondrian-3.html), that he developed the
distinctive, ["neoplastic"](http://the-artists.org/artistsbymovement/neo-plasticism) style for which he is most famous.
[Neoplastic](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/n/neo-plasticism) paintings are totally abstract and non-representational, and
contain only perpendicular rectangles and lines, and black, grey, white, and primary colors.

### Mondrian's Writings

Most of Mondrian’s [paintings after 1921](http://www.abcgallery.com/M/mondrian/mondrian-4.html) were what he
called "*purely plastic expression*."  Reduced to only the essential elements, these paintings contain only black horizontal
and vertical lines, and rectangles painted in primary colors, all on a white background.

While the evolution in Piet Mondrian’s paintings is interesting, his writings - which explain his perceptions and reasons for creating
this style - are fascinating.

In his writings, Mondrian makes it clear his goal in using "pure line and color" was to compose these essential elements so that the
opposites of form and color would exist "*in equilibrium*."

#### The New Art — The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships

Mondrian completed his book, *The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships*,
in 1931, but by then had been working on it since at least 1921.

This book is short but abstract, prophetic, and very profound - so much so that
[The Collected Works of Piet Mondrian,](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Art-Life-Collected-Twentieth-Century/dp/0306805081),
published in 1987, bears the title as its sub-title.

In this book Mondrian reveals how he believed that art and life follow similar paths:

> In life every sincere effort leads to human evolution, and it is the same in art.  Rightly seen, there
> remains **a single path of evolution** that, regardless of time, **is identical for life and for art....**
>
> This fact that art demonstrates is of great importance for life, because it forms the basis of progress and shows its path.
 - Piet Mondrian, The New Art, The New Life, 1931. [Emphasis in original.]

This realization is key to seeing how Mondrian's vision was not just unique for its time but also quite prophetic.

Mondrian claims that just as his and others’ art has evolved into a composition containing opposites of form and color in
equilibrium, future society will likewise evolve, with its opposites finding their own equilibrium.
If at first this notion seems preposterous, it takes only a moment’s thought to
realize that society and everyday life are rife with opposites:

> The rhythm of the straight line in rectangular opposition indicates **the need for equivalence** of these two aspects in life:
> **the equal value of the material and spiritual, the masculine and feminine, the collective and individual, etc.**
> Just as the vertical line differs in character from the horizontal, so in life the two aspects have their inherent and opposed character.
> But just as in art these lines have different dimensions, so individuals and their groups differ in strength or size.
> **Art demonstrates that life, through equivalence of its opposed aspects - despite their
> different nature - can approach real equilibrium.**

Fully understanding this, of course, requires full understanding of the word "*equilibrium*."

### Explaining Equilibrium

- Image: images/Piet_Mondrian-1930-Composition_II_With_Black_Lines-Compositie_nr_2_met_swarte_lijnen.jpg
- Title and Attribution: Composition II with Black Lines (Compositie nr.2 met swarte lijnen) - By Piet Mondrian, 1921.

A full definition of what Mondrian means by the term "[equilibrium](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/equilibrium)" is beyond the
scope of this article.
In fact, in this book Mondrian asserts that "the word *equilibrium* has caused many misunderstandings and repeated errors."

The [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/) defines it as being “The condition of a system in which competing influences are balanced,
resulting in no net change.” Thinking of *equilibrium* as being a *balance* of "competing influences" is a good start, but
it implies the opposing influences are static, and that even mere symmetry could suffice to balance them.

It’s much easier to explain Mondrian’s sense of equilibrium in terms of what it is *not.*

#### Equilibrium Is Not Symmetry nor Harmony

- Image: images/Piet_Mondrian-1937-Composition_With_Blue-Compositie_met_blauw.jpg
- Title and Attribution: Composition with Blue (Compositie met blauw) - By Piet Mondrian, 1937.
- Link: [Public Domain](http://www.abcgallery.com/M/mondrian/mondrian62.html).

In reality, life is in constant flux, so there is no way symmetry can bring these opposing forces into equilibrium.

The word harmony also falls short of defining what Mondrian meant. In The New Art, The New Life he states
“the new aesthetic speaks of ‘equilibrium’ instead of harmony” because “the 'harmony' of the past expresses a veiled state.”

Taken out of context, these excerpts from the book may not make much sense to readers new to Mondrian’s ideas and his way of expressing
them.  Significantly, he wrote the original in French, so his words may well have lost something in the translation.

Although it is difficult to explain and understand what Mondrian meant by the term equilibrium, seeing a sufficient number of his
paintings can help more intuitive people get the gist of what he means by the term *equilibrium*.
And that, of course, this was precisely his intent in painting them - and explaining them in his writings.

### Skeptics versus Believers

Life is full of pairs of opposites - and people who are convinced as opposed to those who are skeptical about all
this comprise one such pair.

As an [open-minded, intuitive person](https://www.seeourminds.com/gallery/9100-real-self_portraits/),
I was immediately receptive and able to understand all this.

Not everyone, however, is all that intuitive.  In fact, there is evidence that
[realistic people outnumber intuitives by about 3-to-1](http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/my-mbti-results/how-frequent-is-my-type.htm).

So the skeptics are no doubt actually in the majority!  If you are one of these people, but willing to learn something new, keep reading.

#### Abstract Art, WTF?!?

Many people grow up with the idea that visual art should be representational - depicting objects in the real world - without
realizing they have been hearing abstractions in music all their lives.
This is because, for millennia, since the earliest [cave wall paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting),
visual art has been representational, while music is - due to its being invisible - by its very nature quite abstract.

This is the path I found myself on when I first learned about Mondrian.
To help people in a similar position understand the painters of the early 20th century, in light of more modern popular music,
I have written a [series of articles](https://medium.com/@tomwhartung/music-meaning-and-modern-art-part-1-of-3-84fe10f480a2) about this
on [medium.com](https://medium.com/).

[Part 1](https://medium.com/@tomwhartung/music-meaning-and-modern-art-part-1-of-3-84fe10f480a2) is about
[Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan)'s song
[All Along the Watchtower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower),
[Part 2](https://medium.com/@tomwhartung/music-meaning-and-modern-art-part-2-of-3-f7fa8f5362f6) focuses on
[John Coltrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane)'s magnum opus
[A Love Supreme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Love_Supreme), and
[Part 3](https://medium.com/@tomwhartung/music-meaning-and-modern-art-part-3-of-3-3d212b8ef7b0) discusses the music of
[The Talking Heads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads).

#### It Looks Too Easy!

When I learned about Piet Mondrian, I immediately thought "a computer could do this."
Since then, I have tried writing a program to produce this type of art - more than once - and failed.

It looks easy to create these compositions, but it is not!  I have learned through experience that changing one of his
paintings - his Composition With Red, Blue, and Yellow, for example - even slightly can destroy the image’s equilibrium.

For proof, see the [gallery[(https://www.seeourminds.com/galleries) of experimental
“[Mondrianesque Compositions](https://www.seeourminds.com/gallery/9600-generic_images-experiments-mondrian/)”
at [seeourminds.com](https://www.seeourminds.com/).


### A Final Thought

Are we here today any closer to the goal of living in universal equilibrium than Mondrian was 100 years ago?

### [(Other Possible) Conclusions]

Those who instinctively understand this tendency towards equilibrium are likely to feel concern for the current trend of increasing
income inequality.

This short book was not published during his lifetime.
I believe this is because he was so far ahead of his time.
It is also so abstract that it is difficult to understand - even for me, and I love abstract stuff!
