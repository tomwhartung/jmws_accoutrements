our process down for when it comes time to upgrade the installations
on jane, barbara, and ava.

Running these commands on bette.
--------------------------------
We should be able to run these on other hosts.

      apt-get update
      apt-get upgrade -y

      (and all the others too, btw):

      please investigate."
Tried googling this but did not see anything about how to fix it.
