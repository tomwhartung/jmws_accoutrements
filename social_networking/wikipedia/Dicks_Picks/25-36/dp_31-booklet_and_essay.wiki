== Booklet and essay ==

The release includes a booklet made of five sheets of paper stapled together in the middle that fits snugly inside the case. The front duplicates the cover of the CD and the back features a short list of "Upcoming gigs" that include the shows in Philidelphia on August 4th and 5th.

Most of the booklet is a long essay from [[The Aquarian Weekly|The Aquarian]] by Jay Saporita entitled "We used to play for silver, now we play for life", a verse from the band's song "Jack Straw".  Spanning the better part of 16 pages, the essay details the several days spent setting up and performing the shows, and includes highlights from moments backstage.

The last page of the essay features a large color photograph of the [[Wall of Sound (Grateful Dead)|Wall of sound]], and the last two pages list the venues and dates, the band's members, tracks on the four CDs, and production credits and copyright information for the release.<ref>Enclosures included with Dick's Picks Volume 31, &copy; 1974, 2004.</ref>
