== Enclosure ==

Included with the release is a single sheet folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure that fits snugly inside the CD case. The front of this enclosure duplicates the cover of the CD and the back contains an oval-shaped photograph, tinted in purple and green, of the sound system.  This photo is credited to Mary Ann Mayer and surrounding it is a background of clouds that flows seamlessly into the clouds on the cover.

The two pages inside contain a series of black-and-white photographs of the band members on stage.  On the left side of the fold are Jerry Garcia, Donna Jean Godchaux and Phil Lesh, and on the right side are Bill Kreutzmann, Bob Weir and Keith Godchaux.

Above this series of photos is a listing of the band's members and credits for the CD on the left side, with a list of the tracks on the CD taking up the remaining three-fourths of this space. Finally, copyright information for the CD is in fine print on the right side of the fold, under the track listing for the second CD.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 12, 1998.</ref>
