 Team Building: Case Study

My Team: Currently 1 Member (Me)
--------------------------------
As evidence of this I offer my sites, seeourminds.com and groja.com .

I am aware that, on the surface, the idea that forms the basis of these sites is not very pragmatic, not very down-to-earth.

And I have extensive experience in facing the difficulties inherent in attempting to monetizing any sort of product based on abstractions.
(I am totally fine with this, and know where I can find more pragmatic people to help me with this, if this is something I decide to do.)

Feel confident that I have the Red and Green covered ok.  It's my idea and I want to make my own decisions.
Also feel confident that I have the Blue covered.

Want to Test My Theory on Myself

Looking for an Extravert with Yellow (Sensing).
Someone pragmatic who can help me sell this idea.

--------------------------------------

I can figure out a way to make money off of this, because I believe it has at least as much validity, if not more.
