 E-Book and White Paper Ideas
==============================
Short, pdf, offered for free.

Reasons to do this:
-------------------
o Describe who I am and what my values are
o Demonstrate ability to reason and write, and desire to work on short leading-edge type projects
o Freemium - to get people's attention and possibly email addresses
o Possibly expand into full-fledged book (for $$$)

Possibly More Practical
-----------------------
Device Detection and CMSes
CRM tool: deliver only on confirmation of email address

GROJA
Explain it in a book.
Should have much content already written

Memoirs
Yeah don't laugh, I have some secrets....
E.g., confront the whole self-esteem thing head on.


Possibly More Speculative (TBD)
-------------------------------
Expert in Absolutely Nothing
This could go with branding such as:
"Small projects for small companies."
High-Level Outline:
1. Idea that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert - top 1%
2. But things change so quickly, this sort of expertise is soon obsolete
3. Idea that it takes 100 hours to be better at something than most people - top 10%
4. Local focus: in top 10% internationally can be top 1% locally!

Advice to Younger Devs
Burnout and unrealistic expectations are real
To maintain passion, one must stay flexible
But a "laundry list" of qualifications is a turn-off to many employers
Happiness depends on being well-rounded, general knowledge
??? Much of this would depend on how I get through this current little hump ???
