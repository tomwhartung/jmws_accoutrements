Time to take the basic ideas I have for this new article on medium and turn them into a draft.

**Try to keep it short and sweet -- and focused on Mondrian's use of the term "plastic."**

LOL as if!  But try!!

## [Introduction -- preferably implied rather than stated]

This is part 2 of a series of articles about the work of the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian, 1872-1944.
For part 1 see [The Prophetic Vision of Piet Mondrian, Part 1: Equilibrium in Art and Life](https://medium.com/@tomwhartung/the-prophetic-vision-of-piet-mondrian-part-1-equilibrium-in-art-and-life-c2b7ba006fd5)

The image above is a poster of a painting typical of Mondrian's distinctive style, which he called *Neo-Plasticism* or *The New Plastic.*

Mondrian lived humbly, and according to the Chronology in his *Collected Writings,* times had to supplement "his small income by painting watercolors of flowers" [1922, p. xxii].
This book quotes a letter he wrote to Arnold Saalborn around 1910 in which he states:

> But since I do not earn much with "my kind of work," I also have to devote a great deal of time to work for the mass, that is,
> a more conventional manner of painting -- so I have to work twice as much [p. 19].

The fact that Mondrian's paintings now sell for amounts that most of us will never be able to afford is proof that his vision was truly prophetic.
In trying to understand his vision, I've spent a considerable amount of time reading his *Collected Writings,* which are quite challenging to read.

This article focuses on what Piet Mondrian means by the word "plastic," because that is essential to understanding Mondrian's writings.

## Mondrian's Collected Writings

*The New Art -- The New Life, The Collected Writings of Piet Mondrian,* is a book edited and translated by Henry Holtzman and Martin S. James first published in 1986.
Holtzman and James divide their book into three parts, and in it Mondrian's writings appear in chronological order.

One of these pieces is *The New Art -- The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships,* which Mondrian first completed in December, 1931.
It is arguably Mondrian's most enlightening work because it draws parallels between his art and society at large.
This explains its use in the title of his Collected Writings.

In the past I've checked out copies of this book from the library, and read the articles and essays somewhat randomly, picking out those with the most interesting-sounding titles.
Recently I obtained my very own copy of this book, and decided to take a more methodical approach, reading the articles in the sequence in which he wrote them, and even reading the introductory material by the editors as well.

## Plastic Means Versus Plastic Material

Throughout his writings Mondrian frequently uses the term "plastic."
Indeed, he refers to the style of his work as the "New Plastic" or "Neo-Plasticism," and this term appears in the title of many of his articles.

In fact, Mondrian called his first book, which was published as a collection of essays, *The New Plastic in Painting.*
He began writing it in 1914 and it appeared in twelve installments in the first issues of the journal De Stijl, between October 1917 and October 1918.

While reading his collected writings, I have found the term "plastic" to be a constant mental stumbling block.
It is clear from the context that when Mondrian uses the word he is not referring to the ubiquitous material used to make many of today's products.

Context makes it somewhat clear that he uses the word "plastic" to refer to the way he constructs and composes his images -- the way he molds reality into shapes of his own choosing.
For example, one of the chapters in his *New Plastic in Painting* is entitled *The New Plastic as Abstract-Real Painting: Plastic Means and Composition.*

One of the reasons I decided to read these articles in the proper sequence is that I was hoping to find a definition of the term, or at least learn to be more comfortable with it when I encountered it.
Naturally, if one wants to learn something, it makes sense to start at the beginning.

Unfortunately, he never really defines the term, and although I had a hunch, I was never really 100% sure what he meant by the it.
Although I had a sense of what he meant, it would be impossible for me to explain it to somene with confidence.

As I went through his articles and essays, it became clear that I needed to back up to and learn about the artists who inspired Mondrian: Paul Cézanne and the Cubists.

## Cubism and Cézanne

In their introductory pieces, the editors and translators discuss how Cubism influenced Mondrian's early work.

In his essay *Piet Mondrian: The Man and His Work* Harry Holtzman writes:

> Mondrian saw Cubism as the new awareness of the intrinsic means of plastic expression, as the destruction of the naturalistic and the mimetic, as the conscious
> construction of the picure-plane, as the dynamic rhythm of its composition of forms in space.  [p. 8.]

In his essay *Piet Mondrian: Art and Theory to 1917* Martin S. James writes:

> Cubism, Mondrian repeatedly stressed, opened the way for the New Plastic.  Shortly after seeing examples of early Cubist work by Picasso and Braque at the Monderne
> Kunstkring in late 1911, he settled in Paris.  His analytical Cubist "compositions" of 1912-13 in grays and browns were based on a favorite motif, the tree, where
> particular forms disappear almost completely in the whole.  [p. 14.]

As I continued reading Mondrian's Collected Works, he continued to use the word "plastic" and would occasionally refer to Cubism.
I never really understood Cubism either, so at one point I started reading Douglas Cooper's book *The Cubist Epoch,* published in 1971.

As I learned about Cubism, I started thinking that it would be a great style to adopt for the next phase of my own Art project, which entails visualizing personalities.
Mondrian's work -- which is based on opposites of color and form -- served as a major inspiration for the first phase of this project, which depicts the opposites Carl Jung describes in his
*General Description of the Types.*

I am basing the next phase of this project on the Big Five "OCEAN" personality traits, and have been researching those in parallel with my studies of Art history.
Learning about and looking at how the various Cubist artists and their paintings evolved over time, I started thinking this style, which is more nuanced than Mondrian's work,
would be a great way to express these personality traits, which are more nuanced than Jung's personality types!

As I became interested in and inspired by the Cubists, I learned that these artists and their work were in turn inspired by Paul Cézanne's paintings.
Indeed, *The Cubist Epoch* mentions him with about the same frequency as Mondrian mentions the "plastic means!"

After reading a few chapters of *The Cubist Epoch* I eventually caved in to this curiosity, and searched for books about Cézanne in the Denver Public Library.
This was during the Coronovirus pandemic in 2020, so I had to put the seven books I found on hold and arrange to pick them via their curbside holds service.

These books are large and printed on high-quality paper, so they're very heavy.
When I went to pick them up it took two people to carry them all out to my car!

It was in one of these books that I finally learned exactly what Mondrian meant by the term "Plastic Means."

## The Plastic Means

Most of the books about Cézanne that I found were either biographical in nature, or used critiques to expound on his place in Art history, or both.

One of the books, *Cézanne's Composition: Analysis of His Form With Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs* by Erle Loran, did not fit into this mold.
And it was in this book, published in 1943, that I finally found a formal definition of "The Plastic Means."

To say that I was excited is a bit of an understatement!

Section III in the book -- which is divided into sections rather than chapters -- is named *An Illustrated Glossary,* and it defines this term early on.
One typically finds a glossary of terms near the end of a book, but Loran's definitions come near the beginning of his book, on page 17 of 136.

Spanning a mere 8 pages, Loran's *Illustrated Glossary* contains 22 diagrams.
Although they are just sketches in black-and-white, these illustrations are invaluable for someone wanting to understand the terms he uses in the remainder of the book.

It turns out that, although my guess regarding what the term "Plastic Means" means was fuzzy, I was pretty close!

-------- So far, so good. -------

Most significantly, this book compares Cézanne's paintings with photographs of his motifs.

These comparisons are incredibly valuable for those seeking to understand why Cézanne is considered the father of Modern Art.

## Mondrian's Use of the Word

In the first section of the article featured in the title of his Collected Works, The New Art -- The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships, Mondrian
uses the term repeatedly, with the assumption that the reader understands


- Societal Equilibrium
- High Universal Morality -- Peace on Earth

He uses the term "plastic" 15 times in the first 12 paragraphs.

- "plastic means:" 7 occurrences
- "plastic expression:" 5 occurrences
- "plastic value:" 3 occurrences

## Conclusion

It's difficult to find a definition of the word "plastic" that corresponds to Mondrian's use of the word.

Indeed, the index to the book Vision in Motion by L. Moholy-Nagy (1961) lists 19 occurrences of the term, but only the first mimics Mondrian's use of the term, while the other 18 references are to the material.

If you are interested in the language of composition in general, and in reading Mondrian's writings in particular, I highly recommend finding a copy of Erle Loran's book!
