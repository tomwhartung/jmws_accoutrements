# Music, Meaning, and Modern Art: Part 3 of 3

This is part three of a three part series of articles written for people who love music but do not understand abstract art.

[Part one]() is about Bob Dylan's song All Along the Watchtower and [part two]() is about John Coltrane's album A Love Supreme.

All three articles use highly-acclaimed works that have stood the test of time to help explain how musicians and painters use
abstractions to add value and meaning to their work.
Spoiler alert: the secret is, when the meaning is not obvious, listeners and viewers need only to learn how to add their own
meaning to the art they hear and see.

Sound complicated? It isn’t! All it takes is a little imagination.

## Exercising Your Imagination

Take a look at Kandinsky’s painting of a Fugue (1914) above and:

1. Take a quick look at the [Wikipedia's page explaining fugues])https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue), reading as much or as little as you like.
   There's no need to spend much time on the page, the videos explain the term much better.
2. Listen to and watch one or more of these videos:
-  This [music appreciation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAFETgpt9PA) (8:29) that explains the basic structure of a fugue.
-  This [video of a "Little" Fugue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVadl4ocX0M) (3:38) by
   [Johann Sebastian Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach).
-  This [video of a "Great" Fugue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WhPUqpaRp4) (6:40), also by Bach.
-  This [video of a "Great" Fugue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s0Mp7LFI-k) (16:08) by
   [Ludwig van Beethoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven).
3. Try to see how the organization of visual patterns in Kandinsky's painting express the structure of a musical fugue.

Hint: Wassily Kandinsky was Russian and at various times in his life lived in Germany and France.
He was well aware of the fact that people in Western societies habitually read things from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.

So - if desired - you can read his paintings from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.

Easy enough, right? Ok, now we’re ready!

## First Four Talking Heads Albums

The first four albums released by
[Talking Heads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads)
are full of wonderful music with very abstract lyrics.

All of their songs are very painterly and full of the vagueness and abstractions that allow listeners to fill in their own meanings.
Three of the four members were students at the
[Rhode Island School of Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island_School_of_Design)
(RISD) so were presumably familiar with the tenets and techniques in modern art.

All four of these albums are very highly rated on [allmusic.com](http://www.allmusic.com).
Specifically, three of the four have earned
[5 of 5 stars](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/talking-heads-mn0000131650/discography) in both critic and user reviews on the site.
The exception - [Fear of Music](https://www.allmusic.com/album/fear-of-music-mw0000196010) -
has "only" 4.5 out of 5 stars in the critic's ratings.

Listening to their sound as it evolves over these four albums, and puzzling over their usually abstract but
always inventive lyrics rewards listeners with hours of entertainment and enlightenment.

In the following descriptions, a heart (♥) icon denotes the love songs, and a star (★) icon indicates songs
that have made a strong and lasting impression on me.

#### Talking Heads 77

Their first album is
[Talking Heads 77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads:_77),
released in September of 1977.
[This album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2y77QjFnuk) is their most raw, quirky, original-sounding release.

The singles from this album are Uh-Oh, Love Comes to Town(♥),
[Psycho Killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_Killer)(★), and Pulled Up.
At the time, many listeners associated Psycho Killer with the [Son of Sam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Berkowitz) murders.
However, it is purposely abstract and not about him or any other specific person.
The song was actually written years before the Son of Sam murders!

The most noteworthy song on Talking Heads 77 is [No Compassion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndUVdzi-HqY).
The theme of this song contrasts strongly with the message of Peace and Love present in much of the hippie music from the 1960s.
Its message is that it can be overwhelming to try to help everyone, that some people are actually in love with their problems,
and for some of us, it might be a good idea to Be a little more selfish, it might do you some good!

At times, I’ve had to take this advice to heart, having learned the hard way it’s easy to care more for some
people than they care for themselves. It’s sad, but true - and such situations can be quite frustrating.

Other favorite songs from Talking Heads 77 are Tentative Decisions, Who Is It? (♥), and Don't Worry About the Government.

#### More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978)

Their second album is
[More Songs About Buildings and Food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Songs_About_Buildings_and_Food),
released in July of 1978.
[This album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjwj25mI2zY) is my favorite one by Talking Heads.

Title and Attribution: Talking Heads - cover of their album More Songs About Buildings and Food.  Fair use.
Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=14884863

The only single from this album is a cover of the [Al Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Green) song
[Take Me to the River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGD8aQ2GKr0).
In 1979 the [version by Talking Heads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ar2VHW1i2w) was ubiquitous on the radio and
it peaked at number 26 on the [Billboard Hot 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100).

The most noteworthy song on this album is [The Good Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMCMudxTTQE).
This song is also purposely abstract, and does not go into any sort of detail about exactly what "The Good Thing" is.

It's a great song for helping to overcome "difficult situations" and
assures the listener a "A straight line exists between [us] and the good thing."
We are left to fill in the blanks with the specifics that apply to our own lives in the current moment.

"I have adopted this and made it my own:
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong."

The positivity in this song contrasts nicely with the negativity in the song No Compassion on their previous album.

Other favorite songs from More Songs About Buildings and Food are Warning Sign(♥), Found a Job(♥),
[Artists Only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCR0YBLSQZ4)(★),
Stay Hungry(★), and [Big Country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dErdvJrv8JE)(★).
In particular, Artists Only and Stay Hungry show they have not forgotten their roots at RISD, and
Found a Job and Big Country show they are quite capable of writing and performing [ballads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad)
which are original, yet tell a story that is relatively free of abstractions.

#### Fear of Music (1979)

Their third album is [Fear of Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_Music), released in August of 1979.
For some listeners, [this album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb6izAqdTnc) may not be as accessible as the other three.
And this relative incomprehensibility may be what cost it a half-a-star in the
[critic's ratings](https://www.allmusic.com/album/fear-of-music-mw0000196010) on [allmusic.com](http://www.allmusic.com).

Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1140591

The singles from this album are Life During Wartime, [I Zimbra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Zimbra), and Cities (★).

I Zimbra is an adaptation of Dadaist [Hugo Ball's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Ball) poem "Gadji beri bimba."
[Dadaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada) is an interesting art movement that rejects logic in favor of nonsense.
However, the nonsensical lyrics take it beyond the abstractness of their other work and lend this song a certain incomprehensibility.

The most noteworthy song on this album is [Memories Can't Wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJu-IABeCws).
It's interesting - to me, anyway - that this is the only song on the album that has a verb in its title.

Memories Can't Wait starts out with the assertion that "There's a party in my mind, and I hope it never stops."
This sounds like fun, but the slamming chord progression and overall hardness of the music belies that assumption.
By the end of the song we realize this is not actually the case - that he does indeed wish it would stop.

"Other people can go home, other people they will split.
I'll be here all the time, no, I can never quit."

By the end of the song we learn the truth: he's struggling with insomnia.
Although he never mentions that dreadful word, it's clear this party is anything fun!

Not using the word lends the song its abstract, painterly quality.
It's like he's dancing around the issue rather than addressing it directly, forcing the listener to engage with the lyrics.

I heard them do this song [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICDJjTlBoMk) once, and it blew me away!

Other favorite songs from Fear of Music are [Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kf4p738j80)(★), Air, and Heaven(★).

#### Remain in Light (1980)

Their fourth album is
[Remain in Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remain_in_Light),
released in October of 1980.
[This album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVGnTE5N1U8) is the most highly acclaimed of their first four releases.

Image: images/Talking_Heads-Remain_in_Light.jpg
Title and Attribution: Talking Heads - cover of their album Remain in Light.  Fair use.
Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=309798

This album is an extremely colorful expansion on the themes first explored in the song I Zimbra on Fear of Music.
It is so different from their first album, it's truly amazing to hear the progression!

The singles from this album are [Once in a Lifetime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFLiKLoxWD8) and Houses in Motion.
Surely you have heard the extremely popular [Once in a Lifetime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1wg1DNHbNU) at some point!

A big reason it is so popular is because it is so vague and abstract that most everyone can relate to it.
In fact, it is difficult to imagine anyone not being able to relate to the sentiment, "And you might ask yourself: Well, how did I get here?"

The most noteworthy song on Remain in Light is
[The Great Curve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW1IqW6kNdU).

With lines like "She loves the world, and all the people in it," the song is ostensibly about a specific woman.
As the song progresses, we learn "She is only partly human being."

Then a bit later, we hear the clincher:

"The world moves on a woman's hips
The world moves and it swivels and bops
The world moves on a woman's hips
The world moves and it bounces and hops."

Voila!  It turns out the song is an abstract portrait of all women.
All of Talking Heads’ love (♥) songs are a bit quirky, but this one’s over the top!

Other favorite songs from Remain in Light are Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)(★), Crosseyed and Painless, and
[Listening Wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEluoeMLTCI)(★).

Outline for conclusion:
1. Compare and contrast Malevich's Black Square to Pollack's No. 5
-  For both: give background, context, and links to more information
-  Which one is more beautiful?
-  Which one is more informative?
-  Which one is more abstract?
-  Which one is more meaningful?
-  Which one is more accessible?
-  Which one do you prefer?
2. "Both of these are extremely powerful works of art that kind of say the same thing:"
-  Abstractions may be simple or complex, but
-  Ultimately the interpretation of a specific work is more dependent on the individual than it is on the artist or the final product
3. Happy Medium: Mondrian's paintings (maybe pick the simple one and link to my failed experiments based on it on seeourminds.com)

#### BYOM: Filling in Mondrian's Blanks

What if I told you that the opposites in Piet Mondrian's paintings can represent any pair of opposites, whatsoever?

Image: images/Piet_Mondrian-1939-1942-Composition_10.jpg
Title and Attribution: Composition No. 10 - By Piet Mondrian, 1939-1942. Public Domain.
Link: https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=37643395

Take his Composition 10, for example.
Because this painting is so abstract and pure, the meaning of its elements is completely open to interpretation.

So, for example, the white areas could represent white people and the black areas could represent black people - or vice versa.
Or, the white areas could represent women and the black areas could represent men - or vice versa.
Or, the white areas could represent older people and the black areas could represent younger people - or vice versa.

Similarly, for example, the vertical lines could represent white people and the horizontal lines could represent
black people - or vice versa - and the white could just be the background.
Or, the vertical lines could represent women and the horizontal lines could represent men - or vice versa - and
the white could just be the background.
Or, the vertical lines could represent older people and the horizontal lines could represent younger people - or vice versa - and
the white could just be the background.

Or, the vertical lines could represent ______ and the horizontal lines could represent ______, and
the little colored boxes could represent ___ and ___ and ___!
Fill in the blanks as you see fit - human life is full of pairs of opposites!

And now you know the true nature of the power lying in Mondrian's Pure Neo-Plastic art!

#### I Want to Believe

The important thing to realize is that, no matter what identity we assign to the opposites in this painting,
each pair opposites - black vs. white, horizontal vs. vertical, etc. - is in non-symmetrical equilibrium.
I want to believe this means that eventually things will work out, and people will be able to live in equilibrium.

The song
[War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPZydAotVOY)
by
[Bob Marley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley)
confirms that this is how things will turn out - or else.

```
Until the philosophy which hold one race superior
And another, inferior,
Is finally, and permanently,
Discredited, and abandoned,
Everywhere is war
Me say war.
```

Plus, I have eyes, I can see what's going on - and

## Conclusion

Image: images/Wassily_Kandinsky-1914-Fugue.jpg
Title and Attribution: Fugue - By Wassily Kandinsky, 1914.
Link: http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/work-101.php

Certainly the fact that Kandinsky's Fugue represents a type of music
may have something to do with it selling in 1990 for $20,900,000.

Links to additional information about the image in the introduction, for possible use in the conclusion.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue
https://curiator.com/art/wassily-kandinsky/fuga-fugue
http://www.myswitzerland.com/nl-nl/fuga-fugue.html

The truly beautiful thing about abstract art is it can take on meanings that were not foreseen by the artist when they created the work.
For example, Pablo Picasso painted Guernica long before Bob Dylan wrote All Along the Watchtower.

-------------------------------

### In Conclusion

To be honest, when I first learned this I was a bit pissed off!
Of course, punk rock was huge at the time so everyone listening to that was a bit pissed off about something!

In this case, I was a bit pissed off that I hadn't learned this sooner.
- It all makes such total sense, in some ways it's like, "duh."
- Too bad teachers think it's more important to teach us about wars and the like.

But sometimes it's nice to have things spelled out in black and white.
Hopefully this helps you better appreciate abstract art!

# Copied From the Beginning

[Not sure whether we want to use this first-person stuff.]

When I first learned about abstract art, I was ready for it, because by then I had spent years listening to the
rich variety of music available in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.
The purpose of this article is to share with you the awakening I experienced in this regard in the art classes
I took at Virginia Commonwealth University [VCU](https://www.vcu.edu) in the mid-1980s.

If you have difficulty understanding how this painting, [Fugue](https://curiator.com/art/wassily-kandinsky/fuga-fugue),
created by Wassily Kandinsky in 1914 could
[sell at Sotheby's in 1990 for $20.9 million](http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/work-101.php), or
if you think Piet Mondrian's paintings are "just a bunch of squares," this article is for you!
