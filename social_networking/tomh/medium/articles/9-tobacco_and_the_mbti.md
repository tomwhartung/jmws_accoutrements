## [Intro - No Heading]

I grew up in Richmond, Virginia in the 1970s.  It was a great time to smoke cigarettes.
They were 25 cents a pack, most of my friend smoked them, and the Cold War gave me a sense of fatalism that led to some reckless behavior.

Unlike most of my friends, I did not start until I started driving.
Omfg driving and smoking go hand in hand just like drinking and smoking!

Good times!

## Lessons Learned From Quitting the Ciggies

When I finally quit smoking "the ciggies" in the 2000s, I learned the hard way that tobacco is a great drug!

When you're down it can make you feel better.
When you're tense it can calm you down.
I don't think there's another drug quite like it.

Too bad it is smelly, expensive, and deadly!

## Tolerating Disequilibrium

I soon discovered that I'd been self-medicating with tobacco &mdash; using it to repress my anger when people'd insult me.
People would say something rude, I'd go smoke, and feel better.
Free speech, "sticks and stones," and all that, right?

When I no longer had that crutch, that place to go to, I had to face this anger.
Unfortunately, some of my "friends" from the old days did't get that, and
insisted on being condescending, manipulative, rude, and flat out insulting.

As a result, some friendships suffered, because I was no longer "Mr. Nice Guy."
These were obviously fake friendships - I am thinking Mondrian would call them "disequilibrated" relationships.

As a result, more than one of these old "friends" can no longer lay claim to that title.
In order to maintain my sanity, I resolved I would not continue killing myself just to be nice to assholes.

## Bullying: Psychological and Otherwise

It's a no-brainer to see that superficial differences - race, gender, size, scholastic ability, age,
etc. etc. etc. - can lead to bullying.

Thinking about this experience in the light of my spiritual portraits, I feel that differences in psychological
type can lead to this sort of disrespect.
In other words, I feel that at least some of the condescension, manipulation, rudeness, and insulting comments I
was self-midicating for with the tobacco may have been due to differences in type.

Over the years I have learned that attempts to ignore this sort of treatment from so-called "friends" can have
many undesireable side effects, including:

- Rumination
- Passive-aggressiveness
- Substance abuse (self-medication)
- Transference (picking on someone else with less power than you)

I am confident that this is a partial list, but should be enough to give you the idea.

## Disequilibration Is Sooo Last Century!

The balance in Mondrian's paintings prove that we do not have to live like this.
His penchant for equilibrium, and his optimism regarding the future of man-and-woman-kind demonstrate that
relationships like this belong in the past, and have no place in the present or future.

Awareness of psychological preferences - your four-letter-type and the fact that others are different from you
in this respect - can help you avoid these traps.

## Sometimes Better Relationships" Means...

If someone treats you with disrespect, the first thing to do is confront them about it.

As a person who is not the least bit argumentative, this is difficult for me.
That is certainly one of the reasons I'd turn to my ciggies back in the day.

So I go through this step, but do not spend much time on it.
To me there is nothing worse than two stubborn people trading insults while they spiral downward into a Hell on Earth.

In my opinion, that sort of spiralling downard is exactly the sort of thing - albeit on a much smaller scale,
of course - that led to millions of deaths in the two World Wars.
Depending on the response I get - which in my experience more often than not is some kind of "lip" - I move on to Plan B: disconnection.

If people aren't going to respect you, sometimes "better relationships" means "no relationship."

This awareness may not solve all of our problems, but I strongly believe it can help!
