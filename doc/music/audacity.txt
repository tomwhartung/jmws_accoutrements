 Using Audacity to Rip Vinyl to Mp3s
=====================================
The process is simple enough, but can be a little tricky when we haven't done it in awhile.

Click Removal
- I have done this in the past but we do not always want this
- We can call minor clicks "quaint!"
- References for when they are "bad" and we want to remove them:

Quick keys:
-----------
Space - Play/Stop
Ctl-A - Select all
Ctl-1 - Zoom in
Ctl-2 - Zoom normal
Ctl-3 - Zoom out
Ctl-E - Zoom to selection
Ctl-B - Give a track name to the current selction

Adjusting the Input Level:
--------------------------
0. Make sure it is listening to and recording the turntable:
   Edit -> Preferences, Devices - Recording - Device: HDA Intel PCH: CX20590 Analog (hw:0,0)
1. Start with KDE System Settings (Ctl-Alt-S) -> Multimedia -> Audio Volume
   Ensure it is set to Unamplified (?? old advice ??)
   It seems to migrate upwards slightly, weird
2. Play the album and adjust the microphone's input level
   2022-08-13: Unable to set record volume in audacity, so setting it in the KDE System Settings instead
     For the Byrds albums I am doing, around 17% seems to be about right
   Old: For the Bob Marley albums I am doing, around 0.35-0.40 is looking good...
3. Ensure there is no clipping
   Look for Red lines in the meter toolbar -- these indicate the recording has been clipped at some point
   See reference for location of meter toolbar and the relevance of the Red lines
   If they are there when done with a side, reduce the input volume level and start the side over!

Recording Process
-----------------
1. File -> Save As:
   Add the Month and Day when an artist has multiple releases in a single year
   **Note:** Both the name of directory and the name of files are of the form:
      YYYY[_MM_DD]-<Album>
   Save Into directory:
      New: /art/music/analog_projects-ext4/Audacity-3.1.3/<Artist>/YYYY[_MM_DD]-<Album>
      Old: /art/music/analog_projects/Audacity/<Artist>/YYYY[_MM_DD]-<Album>
   Save as name:
      YYYY[_MM_DD]-<Album>
2. Record
   Do not pause when flipping, use that dead space for noise reduction
3. Optional: Noise Reduction:
   Click and drag to select dead space between sides
   Effect -> Noise Reduction -> Get Noise Profile
   Ctl-A (select all)
   Ctl-E (zoom to selection)
   Effect -> Noise Reduction - remove noise

Creating the Mp3s
-----------------
2. Split into Tracks
   Option 1: Find Silence
      Ctl-A (select all)
      Analyze -> Silence Finder
   Option 2:
      Use mouse to select a range of the audio for a track
      Ctl-B to name it
3. Edit the album's metadata
   Edit -> Metadata...
      Artist Name
      Album Title
      Year
      Genre
      Comments -- e.g.: "Ripped using Audacity 2022-08-17"
4. File -> Export -> Export Multiple
   Export into:
     /art/music/mp3-new/<Artist>/YYYY[_MM_DD]-<Album>
   Quality:
      Insane, 320 kbps
   Split files based on:
      Labels
   Name files:
      Numbering before Label/Track Name
   Check the metadata for each track
6. Tar and copy to a linux host, e.g., bette
     tar -cvzf YYYY-<Album>.tgz YYYY-<Album>
     toBette YYYY-<Album>.tgz
7. Fix file names (remove spaces and special characters) by running:
     fixMusicFileNames
8. Use Easytag to finish up:
   - Check mp3 ID data
   - Add album artwork
   - To easily fix spaces in file names, use the Scanner

Tips
----
ALWAYS clean the record first - it can't hurt!

Splitting into tracks:
- Silence finder doesn't work very well on live recordings
- It's much easier to use Ctl-B to add track labels
