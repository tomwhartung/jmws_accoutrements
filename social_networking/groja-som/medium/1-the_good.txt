 The Good: First of Three Articles
===================================
For important background information, see 0-the_good-the_bad-and_the_ugly-overview.txt in this directory.

Theme Song:
-----------
For Artists Only by Talking Heads

The Good Content:
-----------------
I want to help people - myself included - see past the surface.

The Good thing is, I have written a program to help me do this.
In effect, it's rather like a simple language that reveals a lot about an individual in a single glance.

Another Good thing is, it's a simple language: it uses primary colors to represent fundamental traits.

And yet another Good thing is, most if not all religions can agree that our bodies are just temporary shells for what makes us us.
Therefore I believe that our inner qualities are far more important.

A person's external qualities has little bearing on what they actually do.
And it's what they do that really matters.

I Call It "Art"
---------------
I have studied music, drawing, painting, photography, film, and dance.
[Mention of Kandinsky's triangle here.  I am thinking that should be a whole separate article....]

If anyone is qualified to say what art is and is not, it is me.

And I call this "Art."  It expresses how I look at people; it's an expression of how I view our world.
In this respect, I feel it's similar to what modern painters such as Picasso have done.

Bottom Line:
------------
Calling it "art" gives me artistic license.
Publishing more examples will help more people get it, but that takes time, a lot of time.

Getting Bad and Ugly:
---------------------
Down-to-earth, pragmatic, closed-minded people may find this arrogant.
Down-to-earth, pragmatic, closed-minded people thought the Beatles were arrogant, and burned their albums in the mid-1960s.
And who got the last laugh there (hahaha-hehehe-hohoho [link to I Am the Walrus])?

Going off on Tangents:
----------------------
Some will pick up on the patterns more quickly than others.  Some will close themselves off to it completely right from the start.
Such is the movement of The Triangle.

I love to learn and in addition to learning numerous computer languages
I took my first ballet class when I was in my 40s.

I believe having enough examples will enable Artificially Intelligent programs to get it.
If you want to stay ahead of the machines, I recommend you invest some time understanding the idea behind these images.
