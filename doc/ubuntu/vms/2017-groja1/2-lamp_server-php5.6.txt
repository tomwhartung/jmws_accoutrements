 Get LAMP Sites Running
========================
LAMP as in LAM-PHP.  We do Python separately, and will not be doing it on this VM.

Ensure Required LAMP Packages Are Installed
-------------------------------------------
Many if not most or all of these LAMP packages have been already installed
[ ] Install any of the following packages that are missing:
    Commands (as root):
      dpkg-query -l 'package_name_or_regex'   ## if it's not found, it needs to be installed
                                              ## if nothing displays, it is not installed
      apt-get install -s package_name         ## Simulate installation
      apt-get install -y package_name         ## Do it without requesting confirmation
    Required packages:
      apache2
      apache2-utils
      mysql-server
[ ] Install php5 and any required accoutrements:

      https://lornajane.net/posts/2016/php-7-0-and-5-6-on-ubuntu
    All references agree that we need to add a ppa to do this
    As root:
      add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
      apt-get install -y php5.6
    (Try to) install these packages, an edited version of the list of packages from the first reference:
      (http://askubuntu.com/questions/761713/how-can-i-downgrade-from-php-7-to-php-5-6-on-ubuntu-16-04)
    As root:
      apt-get install php5.6-mysql           # Installed OK
      apt-get install php-gettext            # Installed OK
      apt-get install php5.6-mbstring        # Installed OK
      apt-get install php-xdebug             # Installed OK
      apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5.6  # Already installed
      apt-get install php5.6-curl            # Installed OK
      apt-get install php5.6-gd              # Installed OK
      apt-get install php5.6-mcrypt          # Installed OK
      apt-get install php5.6-xml             # Installed OK
      apt-get install php5.6-xmlrpc          # Installed OK
[ ] Check php version currently being run on the command line on groja1:
      php -v   # PHP 7.0.8-0ubuntu0.16.04.3 (cli) ( NTS )
[ ] Check php version currently being used by apache on groja1:
    As tomh on groja1:
      # Put a copy phpinfo.php in /var/www/html/
    Access in browser:
      http://groja1/phpinfo.php
    Find the php version being used in the page
      PHP Version 7.0.8-0ubuntu0.16.04.3
[ ] Set php5.6 as the default for both apache and cli:
    As root:
      # For php in web apps
      a2dismod php7.0
      a2enmod php5.6
      service apache2 restart
      # For php-cli in the command line
      sudo ln -sfn /usr/bin/php5.6 /etc/alternatives/php
[ ] Re-check php version currently being run on the command line on groja1:
      php -v  # PHP 5.6.29-1+deb.sury.org~xenial+1 (cli)
[ ] Re-check php version currently being used by apache on groja1:
    As tomh on groja1:
      # Put a copy phpinfo.php in /var/www/html/
    Access in browser:
      http://groja1/phpinfo.php
    Find the php version being used in the page:
      PHP Version 5.6.29-1+deb.sury.org~xenial+1
[ ] Optional: to set php7.0 as the default for both apache and cli:
    As root:
      # For php in web apps
      a2dismod php5.6
      a2enmod php7.0
      service apache2 restart
      # For php-cli in the command line
      sudo ln -sfn /usr/bin/php5.6 /etc/alternatives/php
    *** If you do this be sure to
    *** set the default versions
    *** back to 5.6

Populate /var/www
-----------------
[ ] Get the seeourminds.com websites' source files in /var/www
    seeourminds.com:
      As tomh:
        Copy tar file(s) to groja1
        Unpack the one we want to use into seeourminds.com/htdocs/

Disk Space Spotcheck
--------------------
[ ] Disk Space Spotcheck:
    /: 2.5G/19G (15%)

Configure Apache
----------------
[ ] Copy an old version of 050-seeourminds.com.conf into /etc/apache2/sites-available on groja1
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l *.conf   ## "Installed version"
    Fix ServerAlias specifications in apache2/sites-available/*.conf files
    As root:
      ci -l *.conf   ## "Copied from host xxxxx and updated for this host"


[ ] Enable mod_rewrite and php7.0, and start apache2 (as root):
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2
      ls -al mods-*/rewrite*
      ls -al mods-*/php7.0*
      ls -al mods-*/mpm*
    If not enabled (or disabled, as in the case of mpm_event),
      run one or more of these commands as appropriate:
    As root:
      a2enmod rewrite
      a2enmod php7.0
      a2dismod mpm_event
      a2enmod mpm_prefork
[ ] Check that we have not yet enabled any sites:
    As root:
      cd /etc/apache2
      ls -al l sites*/*.conf
    Only the sites-available/000-default.conf file should be linked to
      the sites-enabled directory
[ ] Put a minimal index.html file in /var/www
    As tomh:
      vi /var/www/index.html
[ ] Restart apache and test in browser, to ensure we are good to go.
    As root:
      service apache2 stop
      service apache2 start
    Access in browser:
      http://ava
    Should see the minimal index.html file put in /var/www

[ ] groja.com
    As root:
      a2ensite 020-groja.com.conf
      service apache2 stop
      service apache2 start
      l sites*/*.conf
    Should see the sites-available/020-groja.com.conf file linked to
      the sites-enabled directory
    Access in browser:
      http://ava.groja.com


Finding the Right Copy of the Database
--------------------------------------
[ ] Databases used on barbara:
    NOTE: this is FOR REFERENCE ONLY - i.e., it is what we did LAST TIME
    groja.com & seeourminds.com:
      try using current db from lauren:
        seeourminds.com-2016_07_16-lauren.sql.gz
      try using current db from bette:
        seeourminds.com-2016_07_16-bette.sql.gz



Checking the Sites:
-------------------
Checking all sites, in conjunction with getting them to work on jane and barbara:
[ ] Checking the static sites:
    [ ] artsyvisions.com
    [ ] tomh.info
[ ] Checking the WordPress site:
    [ ] tomwhartung.com
[ ] Checking the Joomla site:
    [ ] joomoowebsites.com
[ ] Checking the Drupal site:
    [ ] tomhartung.com

Back It All Up
--------------
[ ] Ensure we have backups of everything, including a copy for off-site
[ ] Set up (semi-)automatic backups as appropriate

[ ] Disk Space Spotcheck:
    /:        2.1G/22G (10%)
    /home:    0.2G/4.5G (4%)
    /var/www: 5.5G/13G (30%)

Final Steps
-----------
[ ] Update apache logs config so we can tell which site each message applies to
    Reference:
      https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-logging-and-log-rotation-in-apache-on-an-ubuntu-vps
    Update all files in /etc/apache2/sites-available
    Change:
      CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
    to
      CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log vhost_combined
    and restart apache2:
      sudo service apache2 restart
[ ] Use logrotate to rotate apache logs weekly
    Reference:
      https://serversforhackers.com/managing-logs-with-logrotate
    Ensure logrotate is installed:
      sudo dpkg-query --list '*rotate*'
    Check installed version of the logrotate conf file for apache into RCS
    As root:
      cd /etc/logrotate.d
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l apache2    ## "Installed version"
    Edit the config file as desired
      sudo vi /etc/logrotate.d/apache2
    This time we are changing it to rotate them weekly and keep a year's worth:
      "daily" -> "weekly"
      "rotate 14" -> "rotate 52"
    and adding these lines to use dates for the log file name extensions (instead of .1, .2, etc.):
      dateext
      dateformat -%Y-%m-%d-%s
