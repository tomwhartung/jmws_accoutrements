## [Cold intro - no heading]

This article is for people who love music but do not understand abstract art.

Using popular songs as examples, this article explains how musicians and painters use abstractions to add value and meaning to their work.
Spoiler alert: the secret is, when the meaning is not obvious, listeners and viewers need only to
learn how to add their own meaning to the art they hear and see.

When I first learned about abstract art, I was ready for it, because by then I had spent years listening to the
rich variety of music available in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.
The purpose of this article is to share with you the awakening I experienced in this regard in the art classes
I took at Virginia Commonwealth University [VCU](https://www.vcu.edu) in the mid-1980s.

If you have difficulty understanding how this painting, [Fugue](https://curiator.com/art/wassily-kandinsky/fuga-fugue),
created by Wassily Kandinsky in 1914 could
[sell at Sotheby's in 1990 for $20.9 million](http://www.wassilykandinsky.net/work-101.php), or
if you think Piet Mondrian's paintings are "just a bunch of squares," this article is for you!

## All Along the Watchtower

The song [All Along the Watchtower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower)
written by [Bob Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan) but
covered most famously by [Jimi Hendrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY),
is a great example of a song with lyrics that are a bit vague.
Surely all music lovers love this song!

Based on the number of versions there are, it’s obvious that many musicians love it as well.

In addition to
[Bob’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jd3iytj9SDQ), and
Jimi’s versions - [in the studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY] and
[at Woodstock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvVz88IHK4o),
there are versions by
[Dave Matthews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOaMQ-R9YGM),
[Neil Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DBewzgXgYk),
[Eddie Vedder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHBSvpzI7Tw),
[John Mayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJlkkRub6MU),
[Pearl Jam and Neil Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePvmDGlE8XA),
[U2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx2re_YBki0),
[Eric Clapton and Lenny Kravitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fMvW_FtALU),
[Dave Mason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n3f8NeUm-k),
[Bruce Springsteen, Clarence Clemmons and Neil Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCVjDFR5xtg),
and even
[Bryan Ferry])https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqg4V4BmJj0)!

[Link for lyrics: https://bobdylan.com/songs/all-along-watchtower/]

```
“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief
“There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth”
```

For one thing, there’s the music. There are only three chords so it’s easy to learn and jam to.
That certainly contributes to its appeal to musicians.

Blues songs also have only three chords, but this is no easy-going blues song.
The driving progression of the chords give those who hear a feeling of impending doom.

And although they are a bit vague, the lyrics confirm that the shit is about to hit the fan!

```
“No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke
“There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late”
```

Ostensibly a conversation between a joker and a thief, the first two verses remain confusing, even after decades of consideration.
The only thing certain here is that the time stealing and kidding around is over.

Surely the next verse will reveal a specific threat!

```
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl
```

BOOM.  No more stealing, no more jokes.  No more joker, no more thief.
And if anything, the vague threat is even more vague now.  Surely it is something far worse than a couple of riders.
Oh-kay.

The scene is a bit more complete, but precisely when this is happening remains unclear.
Also, how are all these people going to fit in a typical
[watchtower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchtower).

How can a story so vague - so abstract, and even contradictory - also be so widely recognized as one of the greatest songs of all time?

#### It's BYOM Art!

If you can love this song - which requires a bit of filling in the blanks - then you can love modern art.
Because whether you realize it or not, when you listen to this song, you are supplying details from - and
feeling emotions felt only in - your own life.

**A big part of understanding modern art is realizing you have to bring your own meaning (BYOM).**

Once they established their own style, painters like Kandinsky and Picasso - and there are many others - did
not set out to create works like
[Rembrandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt) or
[Claude Monet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet).
Those works are beautiful, but they are specific, full of what Mondrian called "particular forms."

Rembrandt’s and Monet’s paintings are incredibly beautiful, but they are ultimately "just ballads."
[Me and My Uncle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAF0-EFCuG8)?
Nice, sure, but I'll take a 30-minute-plus long version of
[Dark Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyBs48VjMho)
any day!

We can all love All Along the Watchtower - because of rather than despite its vagueness - because
we have all been in a situation in which doom is impending!

Now, what if I told you that Picasso painted the aftermath of this apocalypse, decades before Bob Dylan wrote the song?

#### Picasso Painted the Aftermath!?

What happened after the impending doom came and the shit hit the fan for the people in Dylan's song?
The song doesn't yield any clue whatsoever.

Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1683114

When I try to envision the aftermath of the coming of the doom described in All Along the Watchtower, I see the painting
[Guernica](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/coleccion/obra/guernica)
by
[Pablo Picasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso).

It’s similarly structured: a jumble of recognizable forms that make it obvious that the shit has hit the fan!
No more jokers, thieves, princes, women, barefoot servants, or riders.
Even the horses those riders were on are done for!

There are easily several howling figures in this painting.
They may not be wildcats, but the feeling is undeniably the same.

Your vision of the aftermath of All Along the Watchtower might be the same, vaguely similar or it might be different.
Chances are, you never gave it a moment's thought till now.

Now you know how to see the beauty that modern art gives us.
It turns out it was hiding inside you all this time!

#### You Might...

You might think this is some heavy shit, or you might be all like,
[so what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqNTltOGh5c)?
[You might find yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGofoH9RDEA) ... oh, never mind.
Whatever you might think, please keep reading, we're just getting started!

## Jazz Can Be More Abstract

Jazz, especially when it's instrumental and doesn't have lyrics, can be much more abstract than most folk, rock, and folk-rock.

Take, for example, some of the music by John Coltrane.

#### John Coltrane - Alabama

John Coltrane - "Trane" - wrote the song
[Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_(John_Coltrane_song))
in 1963.

Image: images/Ray_Charles_and_John_Coltrane.jpg
Title and Attribution: Ray Charles and John Coltrane - from www.kzfr.org .
Link: http://www.kzfr.org/broadcasts/322

Although he wrote it in response to the
[bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Street_Baptist_Church_bombing),
in
[Birmingham, Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama),
today there is no way to tell that from the song itself.
Indeed, today it is difficult to even imagine
[people doing such a thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-MuWDsv5pg).

This act of white supremist terrorism killed four girls and injured twenty-two others.

At the time, everyone knew this was Trane's motivation for writing the song.
[Listening to it now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saN1BwlxJxA), however,
you might think its theme is similar to that of the song
[Georgia on My Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glggureA_Kk)
by Ray Charles.
Nothing could be further from the truth!

- Compare to Blackbird by The Beatles

#### John Coltrane - A Love Supreme

The passion Coltrane felt for the
[African-American civil rights movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1954%E2%80%931968))
surfaces fully a couple of years later, in his magnum opus,
[A Love Supreme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Love_Supreme).

Image: images/John_Coltrane-A_Love_Supreme.jpg
Title and Attribution: John Coltrane - cover of A Love Supreme.  Fair use.
Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1274626

The album is very spiritual and contains four songs or "parts:" 1. Acknowledgement, 2. Resolution, 3. Pursuance, and 4. Psalm.
You can listen to
[the whole thing on youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll3CMgiUPuU).

Others have written about this masterpiece much more elegantly than I ever could.
One
[article at nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/23/arts/music-coltrane-at-75-the-man-and-the-myths.html)
reviews it in the context of Trane's life and other works, and
[another at wbur.org](http://www.wbur.org/artery/2014/10/10/coltrane-love-supreme-50)
describes why it is still relevant after fifty years.

In my mind, Miles Davis provides the best perspective on Trane's magnum opus.

#### Miles Davis - On Trane, A Love Supreme, and Civil Rights

I first learned the significance of what John Coltrane was saying in A Love Supreme when I read about it in Miles Davis' autobiography.

Image: images/Miles-The_Autobiography.jpg
Title and Attribution: Miles, The Autobiography - cover of the book written with Quincy Troupe.
Link: https://www.amazon.com/Miles-Autobiography-Davis/dp/0671725823

[Here is the whole thing, from pp. 285-286 of his Autobiography, written with Quincy Troupe and published in 1989.]

```
Trane's music and what he was playing during the last two or three years [1965-1967]
of his life represented, for many blacks, the fire and passion and rage and anger and rebellion and love that they felt,
especially among the young black intellectuals and revolutionaries of that time.
He was expressing through music what H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael and the Black Panthers and Huey Newton
were saying with their words, what the Last Poets and Amiri Baraka were saying in poetry.
He was their torchbearer in jazz, now ahead of me.
He played what they felt inside and were expressing through riots - "burn baby burn" - that
were taking place everywhere in this country during the 1960s.
It was all about revolution for a lot of young black people -
Afro haircuts, dashikis, black power, fists raised in the air.
Coltrane was their symbol, their pride - their beautiful, black, revolutionary pride.
I had been it a few years back, now he was it, and that was cool with me.
```
[Separate paragraph.]
```
It was this way for many intellectual and revolutionary whites and Asians as well.
Even his change to a more spiritual music in the music on A Love Supreme - which was like a prayer - reached
out and influenced those people who were into peace, hippies and people like that.
```
[Using only the above, but here is the rest of that paragraph, for possible future reference.]
```
I heard he played a lot of love-ins, which was becoming the rage all over California for a lot of whites.
So he was reaching different groups of people, too.
His music was embraced by a lot of different kinds of people, and that was beautiful and I was proud of him,
even if I liked his earlier music more.
He once told me that even he liked some of the music he did earlier better than what he was doing now.
But Trane was on a search, and his course kept taking him farther and farther out; he couldn't turn back even though I think he wanted to.
```
[Separate paragraph - unused - too sad!]
```
His death created chaos in the "free thing" because he was its leader.
He was like Bird to all those musicians who considered themselves "out" - you, know, "free," out in space:
he was like a god to them.
When he died it was much like when Bird died for a lot of bebop musicans who looked to him for directions,
even though he himself had been directionless for a lot of years.
Ornette Coleman was still around, and some turned to him.
But for most Trane had been their guiding light, and after he was gone they seemed to me like people in a
boat in the ocean without compass or paddles.
It seemed a lot of what he stood for musically died with him.
Even though some of his disciples carried on his message, they carried it to smaller and smaller audiences.
```

After reading this, I bought Trane’s album right away!

#### BYOM: Filling in Coltrane's Blanks

To really understand this music requires a knowledge of some American History.
The web and your local library give you access to a lot of this information, totally for free.

I recommend watching at least one of these civil rights documentaries from the mid-1960s:

- [History of the Civil Rights Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URxwe6LPvkM) (5:52)
- [Alabama City Remembered as Climactic Battle of Civil Rights Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggUt0gJh9U8) (4:27)
- [Burmingham 1983](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0lD37bq8YI) (4:22)

And at least part of at least one of these speeches by
[Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.)
from that period:

- [I Have a Dream - August 28, 1963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UV1fs8lAbg) (17:28)
- [Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Speech - December 19, 1964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r98tT0j1a0) (12:01)
- [Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence - April 4, 1967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qf6x9_MLD0) (53:46)

The more you learn about this period, the more you will be able to appreciate John Coltrane's music.

#### BYOM: Filling in Mondrian's Blanks

What if I told you that the opposites in Piet Mondrian's paintings can represent any pair of opposites, whatsoever?

Image: images/Piet_Mondrian-1939-1942-Composition_10.jpg
Title and Attribution: Composition No. 10 - By Piet Mondrian, 1939-1942. Public Domain.
Link: https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=37643395

Take his Composition 10, for example.
Because this painting is so abstract and pure, the meaning of its elements is completely open to interpretation.

So, for example, the white areas could represent white people and the black areas could represent black people - or vice versa.
Or, the white areas could represent women and the black areas could represent men - or vice versa.
Or, the white areas could represent older people and the black areas could represent younger people - or vice versa.

Similarly, for example, the vertical lines could represent white people and the horizontal lines could represent
black people - or vice versa - and the white could just be the background.
Or, the vertical lines could represent women and the horizontal lines could represent men - or vice versa - and
the white could just be the background.
Or, the vertical lines could represent older people and the horizontal lines could represent younger people - or vice versa - and
the white could just be the background.

Or, the vertical lines could represent ______ and the horizontal lines could represent ______, and
the little colored boxes could represent ___ and ___ and ___!
Fill in the blanks as you see fit - human life is full of pairs of opposites!

And now you know the true nature of the power lying in Mondrian's Pure Neo-Plastic art!

#### I Want to Believe

The important thing to realize is that, no matter what identity we assign to the opposites in this painting,
each pair opposites - black vs. white, horizontal vs. vertical, etc. - is in non-symmetrical equilibrium.
I want to believe this means that eventually things will work out, and people will be able to live in equilibrium.

The song
[War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPZydAotVOY)
by
[Bob Marley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley)
confirms that this is how things will turn out - or else.

```
Until the philosophy which hold one race superior
And another, inferior,
Is finally, and permanently,
Discredited, and abandoned,
Everywhere is war
Me say war.
```

Plus, I have eyes, I can see what's going on - and
[I want to believe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbBX6aEzEz8).

## First Four Talking Heads Albums

The first four albums released by
[Talking Heads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads)
are full of wonderful music with very abstract lyrics.

All of their songs are very painterly and full of the vagueness and abstractions that allow listeners to fill in their own meanings.
Three of the four members were students at the
[Rhode Island School of Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island_School_of_Design)
(RISD) so were presumably familiar with the tenets and techniques in modern art.

All four of these albums are very highly rated on [allmusic.com](http://www.allmusic.com).
Specifically, three of the four have earned
[5 of 5 stars](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/talking-heads-mn0000131650/discography) in both critic and user reviews on the site.
The exception - [Fear of Music](https://www.allmusic.com/album/fear-of-music-mw0000196010) -
has "only" 4.5 out of 5 stars in the critic's ratings.

Listening to their sound as it evolves over these four albums, and puzzling over their usually abstract but
always inventive lyrics rewards listeners with hours of entertainment and enlightenment.

In the following descriptions, a heart (♥) icon denotes the love songs, and a star (★) icon indicates songs
that have made a strong and lasting impression on me.

#### Talking Heads 77

Their first album is
[Talking Heads 77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads:_77),
released in September of 1977.
[This album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2y77QjFnuk) is their most raw, quirky, original-sounding release.

Image: images/Talking_Heads-Talking_Heads_77.png (Note: use the .png, not the jpg!)
Title and Attribution: Talking Heads - cover of their album Talking Heads 77, by Sire Records.  Public Domain.
Link: https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=14296307

The singles from this album are Uh-Oh, Love Comes to Town(♥),
[Psycho Killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_Killer)(★), and Pulled Up.
At the time, many listeners associated Psycho Killer with the [Son of Sam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Berkowitz) murders.
However, it is purposely abstract and not about him or any other specific person.
The song was actually written years before the Son of Sam murders!

The most noteworthy song on Talking Heads 77 is [No Compassion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndUVdzi-HqY).
The theme of this song contrasts strongly with the message of Peace and Love present in much of the hippie music from the 1960s.
Its message is that it can be overwhelming to try to help everyone, that some people are actually in love with their problems,
and for some of us, it might be a good idea to Be a little more selfish, it might do you some good!

At times, I’ve had to take this advice to heart, having learned the hard way it’s easy to care more for some
people than they care for themselves. It’s sad, but true - and such situations can be quite frustrating.

Other favorite songs from Talking Heads 77 are Tentative Decisions, Who Is It? (♥), and Don't Worry About the Government.

#### More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978)

Their second album is
[More Songs About Buildings and Food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Songs_About_Buildings_and_Food),
released in July of 1978.
[This album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjwj25mI2zY) is my favorite one by Talking Heads.

Image: images/Talking_Heads-More_Songs_About_Buildings_and_Food.jpg
Title and Attribution: Talking Heads - cover of their album More Songs About Buildings and Food.  Fair use.
Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=14884863

The only single from this album is a cover of the [Al Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Green) song
[Take Me to the River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGD8aQ2GKr0).
In 1979 the [version by Talking Heads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ar2VHW1i2w) was ubiquitous on the radio and
it peaked at number 26 on the [Billboard Hot 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100).

The most noteworthy song on this album is [The Good Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMCMudxTTQE).
This song is also purposely abstract, and does not go into any sort of detail about exactly what "The Good Thing" is.

It's a great song for helping one overcome "difficult situations" and
assures the listener a "A straight line exists between [us] and the good thing."
We are left to fill in the blanks with the specifics that apply to our own lives in the current moment.

"I have adopted this and made it my own:
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong."

The positivity in this song contrasts nicely with the negativity in the song No Compassion on their previous album.

Other favorite songs from More Songs About Buildings and Food are Warning Sign(♥), Found a Job(♥),
[Artists Only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCR0YBLSQZ4)(★),
Stay Hungry(★), and [Big Country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dErdvJrv8JE)(★).
In particular, Artists Only and Stay Hungry show they have not forgotten their roots at RISD, and
Found a Job and Big Country show they are quite capable of writing and performing [ballads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad)
which are original, yet tell a story that is relatively free of abstractions.

#### Fear of Music (1979)

Their third album is [Fear of Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_Music), released in August of 1979.
For some listeners, [this album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb6izAqdTnc) may not be as accessible as the other three.
And this relative incomprehensibility may be what cost it a half-a-star in the
[critic's ratings](https://www.allmusic.com/album/fear-of-music-mw0000196010) on [allmusic.com](http://www.allmusic.com).

Title and Attribution: Talking Heads - cover of their album Fear of Music.  Fair use.
Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1140591

The singles from this album are Life During Wartime, [I Zimbra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Zimbra), and Cities (★).

I Zimbra is an adaptation of Dadaist [Hugo Ball's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Ball) poem "Gadji beri bimba."
[Dadaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada) is an interesting art movement that rejects logic in favor of nonsense.
However, the nonsensical lyrics take it beyond the abstractness of their other work and lend this song a certain incomprehensibility.

The most noteworthy song on this album is [Memories Can't Wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJu-IABeCws).
It's interesting - to me, anyway - that this is the only song on the album that has a verb in its title.

Memories Can't Wait starts out with the assertion that "There's a party in my mind, and I hope it never stops."
This sounds like fun, but the slamming chord progression and overall hardness of the music belies that assumption.
By the end of the song we realize this is not actually the case - that he does indeed wish it would stop.

"Other people can go home, other people they will split.
I'll be here all the time, no, I can never quit."

By the end of the song we learn the truth: he's struggling with insomnia.
Although he never mentions that dreadful word, it's clear this party is anything fun!

Not using the word lends the song its abstract, painterly quality.
It's like he's dancing around the issue rather than addressing it directly, forcing the listener to engage with the lyrics.

I heard them do this song [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICDJjTlBoMk) once, and it blew me away!

Other favorite songs from Fear of Music are [Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kf4p738j80)(★), Air, and Heaven(★).

#### Remain in Light (1980)

Their fourth album is
[Remain in Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remain_in_Light),
released in October of 1980.
[This album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVGnTE5N1U8) is the most highly acclaimed of their first four releases.

Image: images/Talking_Heads-Remain_in_Light.jpg
Title and Attribution: Talking Heads - cover of their album Remain in Light.  Fair use.
Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=309798

This album is an extremely colorful expansion on the themes first explored in the song I Zimbra on Fear of Music.
It is so different from their first album, it's truly amazing to hear the progression!

The singles from this album are [Once in a Lifetime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFLiKLoxWD8) and Houses in Motion.
Surely you have heard the extremely popular [Once in a Lifetime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1wg1DNHbNU) at some point!

A big reason it is so popular is because it is so vague and abstract that most everyone can relate to it.
In fact, it is difficult to imagine anyone not being able to relate to the sentiment, "And you might ask yourself: Well, how did I get here?"

The most noteworthy song on Remain in Light is
[The Great Curve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW1IqW6kNdU).

With lines like "She loves the world, and all the people in it," the song is ostensibly about a specific woman.
As the song progresses, we learn "She is only partly human being," then comes the clincher:

"The world moves on a woman's hips
The world moves and it swivels and bops
The world moves on a woman's hips
The world moves and it bounces and hops."

Voila!  It turns out the song is an abstract portrait of all women.  I guess writing about just one would be too boring!

Other favorite songs from Remain in Light are Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)(★), Crosseyed and Painless, and
[Listening Wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEluoeMLTCI)(★).


## Conclusion

Title and Attribution: Fugue - By Wassily Kandinsky, 1914.

Certainly the fact that Kandinsky's Fugue represents a type of music
may have something to do with it selling in 1990 for $20,900,000.

The truly beautiful thing about abstract art is it can take on meanings that were not foreseen by the artist when they created the work.
For example, Pablo Picasso painted Guernica long before Bob Dylan wrote All Along the Watchtower.

To be honest, when I first learned this I was a bit pissed off!
Of course, punk rock was huge at the time so everyone listening to that was a bit pissed off about something!

- It all makes such total sense, in some ways it's like, "duh."
- Too bad teachers think it's more important to teach us about wars and the like.

But sometimes it's nice to have things spelled out in black and white.
Hopefully this helps you better appreciate abstract art!
