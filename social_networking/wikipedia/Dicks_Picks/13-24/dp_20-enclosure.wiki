==Enclosure==

The release includes two sheets of paper stapled together in the middle, yielding an eight-page enclosure. The front duplicates the cover of the CD and the back features a circular outline of a [[Steal Your Face|stealie skull]] in red over a color photograph of a path in the woods extending into the distance.

The first two pages feature a [[collage]] consisting of a ticket stub for the September 28th show and a fan letter from "A Dead Head" along with three black-and-white photographs of Jerry Garcia, Phil Lesh with Donna Jean Godchaux, and Bob Weir.  Behind these items is a background photo of the orange leaves of a [[maple tree]] in autumn.

The fan letter states that its author has "always felt it to be unfair to force Dead Heads to turn to illegitimate & poor quality bootlegs" and suggests the band "put out a line of recordings of your concerts."

The middle two pages feature a [[photomontage]] of three color photographs of Keith Godchaux, Bill Kruetzmann with Mickey Hart, and the entire band on stage.  These appear in front of a grey-ish background containing a blurry wing in the remaining upper right [[Quadrant_(plane_geometry)|quadrant]].

The last two pages list the contents of and credits for the release, against a background containing a dark blue photograph of a crescent moon at the bottom of the second page.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 20, &copy; 1976, 2001.</ref>
