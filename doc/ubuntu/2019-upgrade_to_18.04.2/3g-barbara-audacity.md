Installing audacity on barbara, which is running ubuntu 18.04.

FYI, tried installing it using the GUI, and it failed repeatedly, probably because it requires using a special ppa.

## References

This one looks like the best, but it is also quite out of date:

- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Audacity

These two agree on the same, very simple process.

## Installation

Run as root:

```
apt-get update
apt-get install audacious
```



## Try It Out

Try recording something on vinyl.

Hmmmm.
