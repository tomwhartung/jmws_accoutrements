 Experimenting With Extras
===========================
Making notes on how to install "extra" packages we want to experiment with
so that if we like them we have the instructions readily available for
next time.

Running these commands on barbara
---------------------------------
We should be able to run these commands on other hosts.

Install the Sublime text editor
-------------------------------
I am happy with vi, and it is pretty much always there, but I want to install
sublime because:

o It was definitely ok when I used it before (but I like vi, so...)
o I would think it has matured and gotten better since the last time I tried it
o This real python class recommends it, and they might know more about it than I do

The process is pretty easy - only one reference needed!

[ ] Download the latest .deb file from:
      http://www.sublimetext.com/
[ ] Move the .deb file to the apt archives dir:
    As tomh:
      cd /var/cache/apt/archives
      sudo mv ~/Downloads/sublime-text_build-3126_amd64.deb .
      l sublime-text_build-3126_amd64.deb 
[ ] Simulate installing it:
    As tomh:
      sudo apt-get -s install ./sublime-text_build-3126_amd64.deb
[ ] Install it for realsies:
    As tomh:
      sudo apt-get install ./sublime-text_build-3126_amd64.deb
[ ] Note:
      The command to run sublime is not "sublime" or "sublime-text" , it's "subl"
[ ] Make sure it's in our path, and make sure we can run it:
    As tomh:
      which subl   ## /usr/bin/subl
      subl
