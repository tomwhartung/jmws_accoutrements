References found concerning the various file formats available for publishing ebooks.

## The Main Concern: Images

### Initial Impressions

Putting "thumbnail" images in tables works fine in odt, docx, and pdf files.

Following are some disappointments found when converting odt to epub, mobi, and azw3 formats.

- Tables of images look like crap
- Centered images are no longer centered
- Captions can be misplaced from the image at some screen sizes

### Brute Force Fix

Next time consider:

- Combining images with their captions into a single jpg
- Combining multiple images into one, each including its caption, into a single jpg

This will be foolproof but will also require a bit of work.

## Exporting and Converting

### Exporting

- Exporting a pdf from Libre Office works ok
- Exporting an epub from libre office does not work at this time
  - Tried all options

### Converting

- Use calibre to convert
  - Add odt or docx file
  - Convert option opens a dialog box
  - Have NOT tried all options - not by a long shot

The conversion dialog box contains a lot of options and one group of them is dependent on the output file type.

- Converting with calibre works much better than exporting from libre office
- There are still issues with the images, though
  - Tables of images do not look right
  - The images are not centered on pages with just one image

I did not try all the options, though - and there are a lot of them.
