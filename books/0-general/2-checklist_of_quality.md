Checklist to apply when polishing the contents of a book when finishing it up.

## Checklist

### Essential

- [ ] Anything written about images must include how they represent the personality

### For Best Results

- [ ] Present tense whenever possible
- [ ] Little to no first person - e.g., ok in preface and footnotes
- [ ] Little to no passive voice - e.g., ok to avoid first person
- [ ] Eliminate fuzziness: "seems like," "could be," "perhaps," "maybe," "possibly," etc.
- [ ] Eliminate superfluous redundancy [sic]

### For Consideration

- [ ] Minimize contractions
- [ ] Minimize implied first person - e.g., opinions
