 WordPress Deployment Notes:
=============================
When deploying, I like to copy the db on my development or test host to production.

The Process: (tested 3/24/2016)
-------------------------------
1. Backup db on jane (or bette) and in production
   jane (or bette): bu tw 01-before_changing_urls_to_www
   lauren: bu tw 01-before_updating_to_latest
2. Change URLs to point to www:
   jane (or bette): Admin -> General Settings
   Change the WordPress Address (URL) to point to www
   Change the Site Address (URL) to point to www
   Click on Save Changes button
3. Backup copy of db with the new URLs:
   jane (or bette): gobu
   jane (or bette): bu tw 02-changed_urls_to_www
4. Copy new db to lauren:
   jane (or bette): toLauren tomwhartung.com-2016_03_24-jane-02-changed_urls_to_www
5. Restore and re-backup db on host where the URLs were changed:
   jane (or bette): rs tw 01-before_changing_urls_to_www
   jane (or bette): bu tw 03-changed_urls_back_to_jane
6. Take the site down:
   lauren as root:
      cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
      rm 080-*
      service apache2 restart
7. Pull latest code on lauren:
   gotwc
   gac p
   gotwt
   gp
8. Restore db using version from jane (or bette):
   lauren: rs -h jane tw 02-changed_urls_to_www
9. Bring the site back up:
   lauren as root:
      cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
      ln -s ../sites-available/080-* .
      service apache2 restart
10. Test site
11. Backup new production db just to be safe
   lauren: bu tw 02-after_updating_to_latest

Warning: This can cause issues, and specifically ...
-----------------------------------------------------
Here is an important note that it took many hours to figure out!
WP stores a URL containing the canonical host name in the database.

o  E.g., http://bette.tomwhartung.com

This value is ALSO defined in the admin console under:

o  Admin -> Settings -> General -> WordPress Address (URL)
o  Admin -> Settings -> General -> Site Address (URL)

This value is ALSO defined in wp-config.php (near the end) as:

o  WP_HOME
o  WP_SITEURL

EVEN IF THESE VALUES ARE CORRECT, THE VALUE STORED IN THE DB MAY BE WRONG!  I KNOW!!!

This can cause issues when copying the DB between hosts.

The Fix
-------
How to fix issues where the WP site is looking for resources on a development or test host (due to copying the DB):

1. Access the Admin -> Settings -> General page
   Note that these values are NOT editable
2. Comment out the lines that define WP_HOME and WP_SITEURL in settings.php
3. Reload the Admin -> Settings -> General page
   Note that these values are NOW editable
4. Edit the settings in the Admin page (even if they are correct)
5. Scroll down and click Save Changes
6. Un-comment the lines that define WP_HOME and WP_SITEURL in settings.php

Good to know!
