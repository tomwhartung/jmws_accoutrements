# Title

The New Art - The New Life: 100 Years Later

# Goal - The Big Picture

To be able to reference this article in a subsequent article about my vision, and
to be able to reference the article about my vision in a subsequent article about the
goals and reasons for creating seeourminds.com .

# My Point

I like Mondrian's idealism and want to contribute to the awareness of the need for more
equlibrium and desire for equivalent relationships.

Or something like that.

# My Take

One can't create the same sort art that Mondrian created, for that would not be art.

## Ideas I Like:

- Equilibrium
- Honesty
- Learning about and revealing inner traits and energies

## Parallels With Archetypes

- Breaking things down into essential elements (N/S and F/T) so that we can see them
- Removing distracting surface shit

# Possible Ending

This short book was not published during his lifetime.
I believe this is because he was so far ahead of his time.
It is also so abstract that it is difficult to understand - even for me, and I love abstract stuff!

# Body

In 1911, the Dutch painter [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) (1876-1944) moved from The Netherlands to Paris.
He soon began contributing to the
[De Stijl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl) - Dutch for "The Style" - art movement.

Mondrian started out painting representational, "particular" paintings of such things as trees and landscapes.
His paintings gradually became more and more abstract until all representation was "annihilated."

Reduced to only the essential elements, his later work consisted of images
containing black perpendicular lines and rectangles painted in primary colors on a white background.
He called this type of painting "Pure Neo-Plasticism" and the goal of his paintings was to
compose these essential elements so that these opposites of color and form would exist in equilibrium.

It looks easy to create these compositions, but it is not!

I have learned through experience that changing one of his paintings - his Composition With Red, Blue, and Yellow,
for example - even slightly destroys the image’s equilibrium.
For proof, see the gallery of experimental “Mondrianesque Compositions” at seeourminds.com.

The evolution in his paintings is interesting, but his writings - which explain his
perceptions and reasons for painting like this, are fascinating.

## The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships

Mondrian completed his final book
[The New Art - The New Life: A Culture of Pure Relationships](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Art-Life-Collected-Twentieth-Century/dp/0306805081)
in 1931, but by then had been working on it since at least 1921.
That may not quite be 100 years ago, but it's close enough.

In this book he claims that just as art has evolved into a composition containing opposites of form and color in equilibrium,
so will future society.
Following is a quote from the book's Introduction, written by Mondrian in 1932:

> The culture of art demonstrates that only *man's development* in the distant future can create universal equilibrium through the *establishment of equivalent relationships.* These relationships are already realized in pure art - art free from figuration and all limiting form - expressing the beauty of equivalent relationships exclusively through pure line and color.  This art is an image of the ideal human goal toward which humanity is moving.

Are we here today any closer to the goal of living in universal equilibrium than Mondrian was 100 years ago?
Join me in taking a look at some more quotes from this book and see if we can answer that question!

# Annotated Quotes

## Introduction to The New Art - The New Life (1932)

> The culture of art demonstrates that ....  (Used this quote.)
(p. 278)

> Until now the search for universal equilibrium has been neglected in favor of individual interests.
> Art demonstrates that, as long as these dominate, world equilibrium cannot exist.
> To achieve universal equilibrium, the new art had to sacrifice the beauty of limiting and particular form in order to
> establish equivalent relationships through their universal aspect of color and line.
(p. 280)

## The New Art - The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships (1931)

Written over a period of three years, based on ideas developed over the previous decade, but never published during his lifetime.

*All emphasis is in the original.*

> If art is an expression of life and anticipates it, we can state that the new life is *the culture of equivalent relationships.*
> Just as with the plastic means in art, it is evident that for this life our mentality must become more ore less purified,
> not in an old-fashioned puritanical way, but so as to rise above the oppression of limiting, particular forms.
> Thus in the same way as art, life reaches a state of real equilibrium
> *through pure and equivalent relationships of increasingly free individuals.*
(p. 248)

I see parallels between what he is saying in the next quote, about subject and particular form,
in the (supposed) trend to ignoring demographics (race, gender, age, etc.) in hiring.
In reality, progress in this area has been made, but there is still a ways to go.

> Today we see subject and particular form, once of such great importance in the work,
> rejected not only as being a primitive means of expression, but also as limiting expression.
> Until now their use has been prolongd by tradition and necessity - equally by convention and inertia.
(p. 249)

In this evolution of art and life it is sincerity, rather than conformity, that matters:

> In life every sincere effort leads to human evolution, and it is the same in art.
> Rightly seen, there remains *a single path of evolution* that, regardless of time, *is identical for life and for art.*
(p. 249)

> By using subject matter or even particular form alone, figurative art always shows a descriptive,
> literary side that veils the purely plastic expression of line, color, and relationships.
(p. 251)

It is easier for me to define what equilibrium is *not* - for example, the images in my experimental "Mondrianesque"
gallery - than to define what it *is:*

> However, even in the new aesthetic, the word "equilibrium" has caused many misunderstandings and repeated errors.
> The only way to correct them will be by attentive study of the plastic expression of the new art.
> It will be seen that the equilibrium in the new art is not a static state without action, as is generally thought but,
> on the contrary, *a continuous and mutually annihilating opposition of equivalent but unequal elements.*
(p. 252)

> *The physical aspect of man, of life, diminishes in opposition to the spiritual aspect, which becomes stronger.*
(p. 254)

> It is therefore of great importance for humanity that art manifest in an exact way the constant but varying
> rhythm of opposition of the two principal aspects of all life.
> The rhythm of the straight line in rectangular opposition indicates
> *the need for equivalence* of these two aspects in life: *the equal value of the material and spiritual,
> the masculine and feminine, the collective and individual, etc.*
> Just as the vertical line differes in character from the horizontal, so in life the two aspects have their inherent and opposed character.
> But just as in art these lines have different dimensions, so individuals and their groups differ in strength or size.
> *Art demonstrates that life, through equivalence of its opposed aspects - despite their different nature - can approach real equilibrium.*
(p. 254)

I can see how the internet allows for each of us to specialize and find our brand - allowing each of us to
live "in *independent existence consistent with his own character.*"

> Art demonstrates that the true realization of real life requires *individual liberty.*
> The new life will attain this liberty materially and spiritually.
> Although joined to others by mutual equivalent relationships, the individual will be no less free,
> because of the equivalence of these relationships.
>
> The new art gives *independent existence* to line and color in that they are *neither oppressed nor deformed by particular form,* but
> establish their own limitations *appropriate to their nature.*
> Likewise, in future life society will allow each individual in *independent existence consistent with his own character.*
(p. 255)

> Art in its end shows that individual liberty - until now an "ideal" - will become reality in the distant future.
> This requires a stage of evolution in which man will no longer abuse his liberty.
(p. 255)

> By following the rhythm of the two contrary oppositions of the straight line, we can say
> that the real life basic to man is simply the action of equilibrated opposition - for example,
> the double movement of respiration, which is contrary and complementary.
> It is a pure expression of vital rhythm....
(p. 256)

> When we understand the equivalence of contrary oppositions of art's rhythm, we work more consciously to build truly human life.
> For least attention is given to establishing equilibrium through *equivalence of the two fundamental oppositions.*
(pp. 256-257)

A modern man who does not seek equivalence does not have the new mentality:

> With regard to limiting forms, it is not only conventional forms that constitute obstacles to the new life,
> but so do most of the new forms arising in political, social, and economic areas.
> For instance, aristocratic limitations are re-created under democratic forms, and "socialism" often proves
> synonymous with bourgeoisie.
> And with regard to equivalence, we can say that modern man, although cultivated and refined,
> despite his spiritual improvement is not of really new mentality if he fails to seek equivalence.
(p. 257)

> Whether we conceive life as joy or as suffering depends on which is most important to us: abolition or creation.
>
> The beauty and the misery of concrete life consists precisely in the fact that we can escape neither abolition nor creation,
> thus neither joy nor suffering.
(p. 259)

> If evil is synonymous with abolition and thus with suffering, and
> good is synonymous with creation and thus with joy, then in real life good and evil destroy each other.
>
> But in concrete life good and evil oppose each other.
> And it is also a characteristic of life's beauty and misery that we can escape neither one.
(p. 260)

I assert that spiritual portraits "show ourselves as we really are* more than meat portraits.
When we die, what is gone?  What remains here on earth?  Who are we, really?
> But the new art also reveals another thing of the greatest importance: *to show ourselves as we really are.*
> It reveals that frankness and sincerity are the primordial conditions for the new life.
(p. 260)

> Nothing is more unfortunate for life than the concealment of reality: truth.
> Since life is truth, life is then concealed.
(p. 260)

> By enclosing ourselves within the small circle of what is agreeable to us, we unjustly separate ourselves from others,
> from universal life and all its beauties, which then remain concealed.
(p. 261)

> The actions of creation and abolition will become increasingly united,
> so that more and more we will be able to create by abolishing.
>
> Gradually the long periods of abolition and of creation will diminish;
> gradually peace and war will become one and annihilate each other.
> As we appropach *equivalence of the two contrary aspects within us and outside us,*
> we will gradually be less "lived by" life and become more capable of "living."
(p. 261)

> The culture of art clearly shows that life is *continual transformation* in the sense of growth from birth until death.
> Nothing recurs in the same way, nor remains the same.  Thus *life itself is opposed to all conservatism.*
> Only for a time do the new forms recur in a similar way.  Yet, are they actually similar?
> The fact that they often seem identical sustains the conservative mentality, and causes error.
>
> Certainly, conservative action is present in life but always opposed to creative action,
> so that each annihilates the other, and progress - growth - continues.
(p. 261)

> The perfecting of science is one of the principal ways by which human progress leads to a more equilibrated state.
(p. 262)

> In all areas of life, social and economic, we must create new organizations - not in the old way,
> dominated by other organizations - but as true socialism envisages, *self-governed organizations composed of
> producers and consumers in equivalent mutual relationships.*
(p. 262)

> The creation of the machine itself proves that man has already lost much of his animal force and has therefore sought to replace it.
> The machine can free man from his state of slavery.
>
> This cannot happen in a single day.
> But in time the machine can restore man to himself.
> For man *does not live in order to work; he works in order to "live."*
(p. 262)

> The content of Western culture is above all to make man conscious.
>
> Man was not originally conscious of the life deep within him, which we have called "real life" (the essential in man).
> He was more or less conscious of the concrete side of life - the physical, the sensual, the intellectual.
> *Therefore, concrete life is our actual human life, and it is logical that we are constrained to give it first attention.*
(p. 263)

> If life and art demonstrate that evolution takes place through the action of creation and abolition,
> then all the miseries and all the advantages brought by the progresss of civilization *are so many necessities for man's evolution.*
> But we generally see only one or the other of these two actions: thus life is seen either as declining or as unchanging.
> Creation alone would mean no change, and abolition alone would mean ruin.
> But those who see both actions as reciprocal understand life as *eternal growth.*
(p. 264)

> The more human progress asserts itself, the more violently does natural instinct fight against it.
> For progress involves *diminishing the privileges of the natural state.*
>
> This explains the present hostility to all manifestations of progresss and the reactionary efforts in art and in life.
>
> These arise from a narrow conception, from a failure to see clearly.  One does not see the improvement progress brings.
> One is not aware that despite all its defects - which are simply vestiges of man's primitive state - the true content of life
> not only remains intact but shets its harmful disguises.
(pp. 264-265)

> If all men were just and honest, all would be well and universal equilibrium would be spontaneously established.
> If kings were just, a republic would be no better than a monarchy.
(p. 265)

> In life as in art, we must reckon with reality.  Not all men are just.
> That is why those who are just must try *to elevate the true and the just in man,
> must strive to create situations favorable to this development, and must attempt to
> establish a mutual organization that prevents disequilibrium and constrains man to be just in his social relationships.*
>
> By transforming social organization, we transform the individual.
> Those who attept to oppose the new order will nevertheless be obliged to follow it.
> There will be nothing despotic in this constraint.
> And in a probably distant future, order will be imposed only by *mutual necessity.*
(p. 265)

> The day will come when the individual will be capable of governing himself.  The new art demonstrates all this.
(p. 265)

> General concentration upon proper and mutual relationships is the way to solve all the problems of society.
(p. 266)

> Concentration on the mutual relationships of social life will change our conception of life, and thus our efforts.
> Instead of complaining, for instance, that men of our time are interested only in making money by any means,
> we must try to create social and economic circumstances that not only prefent them from resorting to unjust means,
> but will actually impose just means and make them possible.
> Because of corrupt conditions, man is often pressed, if not forced, to be exclusively preoccupied with money.
> Money, that invaluable means of civilization, should be only a "means of exchange" and not
> assume a *limiting form* that oppresses and debases other forms of life.
(p. 266)

> Capitalism as cultivated until now is a limiting form that is abolishing itself and
> will be abolished in the culture of equivalent relationships.
> Already, today's disequilibrated social and economic conditions show that this form has matured and is about to transform itself.
> This form, instead of becoming open, so as to make possible an equivalent distribution of values,
> will probably remain a "form" - as art clearly shows by its transformation of particular form into
> purified form before its destruction of all limited form.
> Although a more stable world equilibrium will follow, the new form will still be too dominated by money to allow it to
> spread equivalently through the world.
> For the future, Neo-Plastic demonstrates for every area *an organization of equivalent relationships and not a new form.*
(p. 266)

**This is a good quote to support using spiritual portraits for transparency and better relationships:**

> Love and friendship play an important role in mutual nonequivalent exchange.
> The new art demonstrates that in order to achieve real equivalence the oppositions of a relationship must be pure.
> To become pure they must first be separated, that is, disengaged from whatever they are confounded with.
>
> When the two aspects of life are confounded, hypocrisy controls and betrays us.
> This is why it is enormously important for the new art to establish *purified forms and pure relationships:
> they do not conceal, they are real and show themselves for what they are.*
(p. 267)

> In communal life the question will always arise whther all are capable of contributing equivalent value if they
> lack the physical or mental power; physically, for example, old people, children, and especially the sick.
> A just solution must be found, for all human beings are basically equal and all are entitled to an equivalent existence.
> This is not achieved by charity or love or friendship, for these qualities cannot create pure relationships.
> *The essential value of each individual entitles him to an existence equivalent to that of others;*
> if disabled, he must be supported *in keeping with the value* that he is unable to realize; he is a communal responsibility.
> This is important not only for those who are incapable of contributing equivalent values,
> but also for the others who, being assured of a livelihood, will have the strength to cultivate themselves,
> to live their own lives, that is, to give up their dependence upon limiting forms.
> The entire community would thus benefit.
(p. 267)

> Why do we not outlaw all arms making and destroy all weapons now existing in our "civilized" society?
> With weapons outlawed, it would be far less easy for men to kill each other.
> But in our society so many make their fortunes or live by these barbaric instruments.
> Again it is *particular interest* that sustains war.
(p. 268)

The key to world peace - it's right here, people!

> In politics it is not enough to work toward internally equivalent relationships, we must above all
> achieve equivalent relationships of international order.
>
> In art, Neo-Plastic demonstrates this necessity most exactly.
> Through intersecting lines, the mutual relationships destroy each plane's separateness so that all unite completely.
>
> The rectangular planes of varying dimensions and colors visibly demonstrate that *internationalism* does not mean
> chaos ruled by monotony but an ordered and clearly divided unity.
> In Neo-Plastict there are, in fact, very definite boundaries.
(p. 268-269)

> Although Neo-Plastic establishes the goal of human culture, this goal points the way for tomorrow.
> And if the mutual equality that Neo-Plastic manifests cannot be realized in life today,
> the new art nevertheless shows that pure forms and relationships can be established,
> and thus a *new organization* that already makes possible a freer and more really unified life.
(p. 269)

> Religion became a limiting form, as the church, but shows its true content as it progressively frees itself from
> its trappings in the course of human culture.
> If art demonstrates that the mutual separation of forms increases their intrinsic value and produces a more perfect union,
> we can also note with satisfaction that the separation of church and state, the separation of religion from learning or philosophy.
> Liberated and restored to independence, everything more easily achieves profundity.
(p. 269)

> Just as art itself has slowly created a new plastic expression of more real equilibrium,
> life itself will slowly create this equilibrium in a new social and economic organization.
(p. 269)

> High universal morality finds its expression in the apogee of the culture of equivalent relationships.
> Art in its end demonstrates that only line and color free from all oppression of form can constitute equivalent relationships.
> Thus in life only the free individual and groups of free individuals can form a mutually equivalent organization and
> become capable of realizing the content of high universal morality, which prescibes that we live for each and for all.
(p. 270)

**This sums it up quite nicely:**

> Every day we are astonished by the complete absence of true love, friendship, brotherhood, kindness.
> Centuries and centuries ago the great mesage of universal love was proclaimed: although its influence is undeniable, man has not changed.
> Therefore, let us not insist upon what has shown itself as unrealizable.
> Art demonstrates that *life impels humanity toward equivalence of its two opposed aspects and
> thus toward the destruction of individual limitations.*
> This is how life can realize the high ideals proclaimed so long ago.
(p. 273)
