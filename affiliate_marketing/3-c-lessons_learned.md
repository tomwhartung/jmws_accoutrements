Learning from my mistakes.

[x] Need legal documents
    [x] These are now in the `/legal` directory of this repo.
[x] I am in this part-time, so use only one site at a time
    [x] Go with CJ Affiliates, because I already have an account and they are on many lists
[ ] Review legal docs for site I am using
[ ] Need flexible links
    [ ] See `6-flexibility.md` in this directory
