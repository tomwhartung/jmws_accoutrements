# CJ Affiliate - Details

- Focus on using Barnes & Noble links from CJ Affiliate - assuming that's possible

## Network Profile

I need to fill out a short form.

### General

> "Describe your business model"

Description:

> My content is unique: I draw images of personalities.  The people may
> be real or fictional, and many are based on books, frequently biographies,
> and dvds, frequently popular series with ensemble casts and occasionally
> movies.  By writing stories about the images that highlight psychological
> patterns, such as opposites attract, I can draw parallels between real
> people and fictional characters - for example, Franklin and Eleanor
> Roosevelt, and Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the X-Files.
> This increases people's curiosity, ideally prompting them to buy books and
> dvds to learn more about the characters and underlying psychology.

### Promotional Methods

> "Select at least one of the following"

Methods: Checking "Content / Niche:"

> Select this option if your business model is based on content, such as
> news stories, personal stories, images, media, music, or video.  Content
> sites and bloggers present original content that attracts audiences
> with shared interests.

### Response:

When I submitted the form - on Thursday 2019-01-31 - this appeared in a pop-up window:

> Important: Your joined advertisers have 14 days to review your Promotional Method(s).

> Content / Niche

> Click OK to confirm:

> - The modification to your Promotional Method(s) is correct.

> - You will not use the new Promotional Method(s) until the 14-day review has been completed.

> - You will review/edit your Network Profile now to ensure it still accurately describes your business model.

**So I need to wait until Valentine's Day before using any links**


## Applications

Applied to Barnes and Noble on 2019-01-31


## Yikes - Only One Site?!?

Checking Account -> Websites I see only one, yikes!

### Adding ArtsyVisions.com

Category: Books/Media -> Books

Description:

> ArtsyVisions.com features "Insights from the Galleries at SeeOurMinds.com"  - stories about one or more images of personalities or "spiritual portraits."
> I can only select one Category but also want to sell DVDs, because they form the basis of many of the spiritual portraits on this site.
> I have re-posted the images on this site with consistently-structured stories because they are the most interesting and enlightening of
> the hundreds of images I have posted over the years to SeeOurMinds.com .
> I have several articles in the pipeline for this site, some are already written while others are still in the initial planning phase.

### Updating SeeOurMinds.com

Category: Books/Media -> Video/Movies

Description:

> SeeOurMinds.com hosts a personality quiz and serves as a repository for raw content for ArtsyVisions.com.
> It features (1) a Portrait Gallery containing images of hundreds of personalities or "spiritual portraits," and
> (2) a personality Quiz people can take, enabling them to buy their own spiritual portrait.
> Many of these images are of fictional characters from movies and shows such as The Wire, Twin Peaks, Game of Thrones, and Cheers.
> There are also images of American presidents, some Founding Fathers, and celebrities such as Mark Twain, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Eleanor Roosevelt.
> The stories on SeeOurMinds.com, however, are of inconsistent quality and structure.  I created ArtsyVisions.com to address this limitation.

### Adding Groja.com

Category: Art/Photo/Music -> Art

Description:

> Groja.com serves as a single point of reference for (1) the back story of how I came up with the idea of drawing spiritual portraits and
> (2) performing conversions, such as signing up for the ArtsyVisions Monthly Newsletter or ordering your personalized spiritual portrait.
> This site is fairly minimal, yet informative, concise, and to-the-point with regards to exactly what personality traits these images
> represent and why I draw them.
> The only affiliate links are in the books section of the About page.

### Adding TomHartung.com

Category: Books

Description:

> TomHartung.com is an experimental site that allows me to sell books that (1) are source material
> for the spiritual portraits I draw and (2) are teaching me how to monetize my unique idea.
> For example, I liked Ron Chernow's biography of Alexander Hamilton so much I bought books
> about other founding fathers.
> And in addition to Deep Work by Cal Newport, I am also finding
> books by Tim Ferriss, Dorie Clark, and Daniel Pink to be very helpful in finding ways
> to monetize my passion for drawing personalities.
> The whole point of my ArtsyVisions/Groja/SeeOurMinds work is that some of us are different.
> I use this site to express my unconventional opinions and sell the books that feed them.
