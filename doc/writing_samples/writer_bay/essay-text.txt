Today, some people might feel that working fourty hours a week is like being a slave.
This short essay asserts that nothing could be further from the truth.

First, do the math.
There are 168 hours in a week, and fourty hours is less than one-fourth of this.
This fact makes the 24/7/365 obligation of a slave more than four times the obligation of a full-time employee.

Second, compare the options of a full-time employee to those of a slave.
The employee is free to quit and find a new job at anytime, and can even choose to not work for anyone whatsoever.

A slave does not have these options.
Worse, a slave can be sold, separating them from their family forever.

Third, consider the physical punishments.
Keeping slaves in chains was a standard practice, made unnecessary only by the constant threat of severe physical torture.

A slave owner can legally subject a slave to severe flogging for any infraction whatsoever.
There are stories of owners inflicting hundreds of lashes at a time.
This could actually kill the slave, and at best left them scarred - physically and emotionally - for life.

Sexual abuse of slaves by their owners is also possibile.
As a slave, a woman could be raped repeatedly, and even ultimately forced to bear the child of her abuser, without any recourse whatsoever.

In contrast, today a boss who inflicts any sort of physical punishment on a full-time employee is liable to criminal prosecution.
More than that, a man today who makes even a seemingly innocent comment about a woman's appearance can find himself the defendant in a sexual harrassment lawsuit.

The notion that someone working fourty hours a week is a slave is preposterous.
Certainly, on-going financial and family obligations might make a person feel trapped in a job they don't like.

Full-time work, though, is a far, far cry from slavery.
Anyone claiming there is more than a superficial similarity between the two has surely not given the notion serious, objective consideration.
