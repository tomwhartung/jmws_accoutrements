 Getting Comfortable
=====================
Install the basic stuff we need to get around and do the other stuff.

This is the process we are running to set up bette.
---------------------------------------------------
Parts of it should be perfectly usable on other hosts.
Trying to make this more of a command line process, so we can identify
the essentials and get them set up, making getting other stuff done easier


Desktop Necessities for Comfortableness
---------------------------------------
[ ] Home Directory
    Restore home directory from backup, or take a copy from another host
[ ] Install any new updates
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
[ ] Install rcs, vim, subversion, openssh-server, git, git-svn, (??git-stuff, git-magic??)
    sudo apt-get install rcs vim subversion
    sudo apt-get install openssh-server
    sudo apt-get install git git-svn
[ ] Set up root account: .bashrc, links to .bash_aliases*
    As root:
      ln -s ~tomh/.bash_aliases .
      ln -s ~tomh/.bash_aliases-jane  .
      ln -s ~tomh/bin  .
      ln -s ~tomh/.vimrc   .
      vi .bashrc    ## Add cusTOMizations
      which ci
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l .bashrc
[ ] Update /etc/hosts and verify ssh is working
    Installing openssh-server seems to be enough to get it going
    As tomh:
      Remove or rename ~/.ssh/known-hosts
      Push over a copy of /etc/hosts
    As root:
      cd /etc
      mkdir RCS
      ci -l hosts fstab
      cat hosts
      more ~tomh/tmp/hosts
      mv ~tomh/tmp/hosts .
      vi hosts
      ci -l hosts
    Test using ssh to get from host to host.
[ ] Settings
    Go through list making initial adjustments:
    Appearance -> Look -> Background (find something nice!)

[ ] Install xscreensaver-gl-extra
    apt-get install xscreensaver-gl-extra
[ ] Install unity-tweak-tool
    apt-get install unity-tweak-tool
[ ] Start and lock xscreensaver and unity-tweak-tool to launcher
    Peruse and adjust all unity-tweak-tool for maximum comfort
    As tomh:
      which unity-tweak-tool
      unity-tweak-tool &
      which xscreensaver-demo
      xscreensaver-demo &
[ ] Check man page for other steps needed to get it working at startup
    man xscreensaver
[ ] Remove gnome-screensaver
    As root:
      apt list gnome-screensaver
      apt-get remove gnome-screensaver
[ ] Add xscreensaver to startup programs
    As tomh:
      gnome-session-properties
    Window Manager -> Window Snapping -> turn all that shit off
[ ] Install synaptic and maybe some extra git packages
    sudo apt-get install synaptic
    (?? sudo apt-get install git-stuff git-magic ??)
[ ] Start and lock synaptic to launcher
    As root:
      synaptic

    Reference:
      https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-google-chrome-ubuntu-16-04-lts

      cd ~/tmp
      wget https://dl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub
      apt-key add linux_signing_key.pub

[ ] Install xeyes (part of x11-apps), and add to startup programs
    As root:
      dpkg-query --list xeyes
      apt-get install xeyes
      apt-get install x11-apps
    As tomh:
      which xeyes
      gnome-session-properties
[N] Get rid of annoying icons on desktop
    Note: not seeing these with the new os on bette, maybe it was a 16.04.1 thing?
    As tomh:
      gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background  show-desktop-icons false
[ ] Lock disks [manager] to launcher
[ ] Setup important /art links to external disk

      cd /art; ln -s /media/ext4backupA/art/* .

------------------------------

[ ] Disable annoying popup, asking for keyring password when starting chrome
    Reference:
      http://askubuntu.com/questions/867/how-can-i-stop-being-prompted-to-unlock-the-default-keyring-on-boot?noredirect=1&lq=1
    Click on the "Search your computer" Ubuntu icon
    Search for "Passwords and Keys"
    Ensure the menu option View -> By Keyring is checked
    Right-click on "Login" in the panel on the left
    Click on "Change Password"
    Enter the old (login) password
    Leave new password blank

-------------------------

[ ] Set terminal double-click word boundary preferences
    Edit -> Profile Preferences -> General -> Copy Profile ID
    Plug the Profile ID into the following dconf command:
       dconf write /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:<Profile_ID>/word-char-exceptions '@ms "?_+~·:"'
    For example:
       dconf write /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:a69aef0d-01c0-40a0-a343-7c2d19d66673/word-char-exceptions '@ms "?_+~·:"'
    Reference: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/174728/gnome-classic-terminal-mouse-double-click-selection

[ ] Disk Space Spotcheck:
      /:     6.0G (28%)
      /home: 1.0G (5%)
[ ] Use compizconfig-settings-manager to turn off annoying snapping behavior
    Apparently turning this off in the unity tweak tool was not enough?
    Access compizconfig-settings-manager via "Search Your Computer" icon
    Run and lock to launcher
    Window Management -> Resize Window -> General tab ->
      Uncheck "Maximize Vertically if screen edge hit."
[ ] Setup pythonLibs in ~ (/home/tomh) and /usr/local/bin
    This is now needed for scripts like up, killEmAll, and upapa
    ** The whole /usr/local/bin setup needs to be re-examined **
    ** npm likes to put stuff there too! **
    We don't need all of these, but it's nice to have a local copy of them anyway
    As tomh:
      cd
      mkdir -p iot/customizations
      cd iot/customizations
      git clone https://github.com/tomwhartung/edison_python.git
      git clone https://github.com/tomwhartung/edison_node.git
      git clone https://github.com/tomwhartung/edison_config_tools.git
      git clone https://github.com/tomwhartung/edison_arduino.git
      git clone https://github.com/tomwhartung/edison_usr_local_bin.git
      cd /usr/local/bin
      ln -s /home/tomh/iot/customizations/edison_usr_local_bin/bin/pythonLibs .
