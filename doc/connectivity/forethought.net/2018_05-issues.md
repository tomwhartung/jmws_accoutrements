## Basic Connectivity Issues

### Thu. 2018-05-03:

- First started having issues with connectivity.
- Contacted forethought.net several times
- Talked forethought.net into giving me a new modem, one of their choosing, to replace the one I bought at Microcenter last time I had issues.

### Fri. 2018-05-04:

- Installed new modem
- It took awhile to confirm all my sites were working properly
- Accessing tomhartung.com via my phone - without wifi from the LAN - it prompts me to log into the modem - which is scary!
- Accessing the ip 206.124.10.54 brings up prompt to log into the modem - which is scary!
- Discussed this with Forethought.net, and they said it should ot work that way, so I decided to check everything out from the library

- Went to the library to confirm all my sites were working properly from outside the LAN
- Looks good, everything seems to be working ok, did not get any prompts to log into the modem, even when using the IP address
