==Enclosure==

Included with the release is a single sheet folded in half, yielding a four-page enclosure that slides out of the case, enabling its front page to also function as the CD's cover.  The back features a white outline of a circular [[Steal Your Face|stealie skull]] superimposed on a mostly blue [[bird's-eye view|bird's-eye photographic view]] of some snow-covered trees.

Inside the enclosure, the page on the left side lists the contents of and credits for the release.  The page on the right side features a blue-on-orange publicity poster for the shows.  Entitled "Grateful dead morning glory", the poster includes the dates, location, and ticket price for the shows, "$3.00 [in] advance, $3.50 at the door."  The center of the poster features a skeleton skiing downhill at night while wearing an orange scarf.<ref>Enclosure included with Dick's Picks Volume 22, &copy; 1968/2001.</ref>
