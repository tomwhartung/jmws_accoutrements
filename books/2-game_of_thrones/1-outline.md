These images are based on Seasons 1-7 of the show.

99.1 Future Editions

After watching season 8, I may publish another edition including that, or one including characters from the books, or both.

If I write an updated edition, people who purchase this edition may upgrade for free.

The more popular this first edition is, the more likely it is I will create future editions.
