Lovely People,

I want to start by saying that I really appreciate you taking the time to read my blog and join me on my journey to getting skinny, find love, and debt freedom!

There’s just  one thing. I’m not a finance professional. I am a person learning about myself, my money, and trying to find a honey.

You are smart-so before you do anything with your money consult a well-vetted professional who can assist you with your financial questions.

Also, read a lot of books about money, investing, real estate, etc. Don’t be the poor fool who gets all of their money taken from them because they didn’t know anything. Don’t be that person.

Finally Please Be Advised and Read The Following:

STANDARD DISCLOSURE: In order for me to support my blogging activities, I may receive monetary compensation or other types of remuneration for my endorsement, recommendation, testimonial and/or link to any products or services from this blog. Affiliate links will have an asterisk (*) next to them.

I wish you good luck with your future endeavors!

Michelle
