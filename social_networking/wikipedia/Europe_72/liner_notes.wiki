===''Europe '72, Vol. 1: Wembley Empire Pool, London, England (4/7/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/7/1972 Gary Lambert sets the scene by writing that "the Dead were overshandowed by ''the'' pop culture story in the U.K. at the time, a fleeing craze known as '[Bolan Mania|https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bolanmania&redirect=no]'".  The author goes on to discuss the "[symbiosis|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis] between the U.S. and U.K rock scenes", and quotes "the great British playwright [Tom Stoppard|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Stoppard]" as saying "Everybody had a sense of that".  Lambert then details how "The first shows were scheduled for April 5-8 at the 3,000-seat [Rainbow Theatre|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Theatre]," then moved to "the Commodore in King Street, Hammersmith, instead of the now closed Rainbow Theatre" and then ultimately "turned into two at the building today known as the [12,000-plus-capacity] [Wembley Arena|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Arena], then called Empire Pool", before closing this contribution with "To be continued on 4/8/72. . ." [elipsis in original].

===''Europe '72, Vol. 2: Wembley Empire Pool, London, England (4/8/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/8/1972 Gary Lambert starts off by quoting [Sam Cutler|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cutler]'s introduction of the band on 4/7/72 and continues building on his notes for the previous show by stating "Sam's instincts proved correct: while no one expected the Dead to fill the Empire Pool, they drew more than respectably&mdash;somwhere in the neighborhood of 8,000 paying customers each night".  Lambert then describes the two nights at the venue as if they were one long show, writing that "By midway through the second set on opening night ... all notions of 'British reserve' were clearly out the window" and "on Night Two in London" the Dead took "an even more fearless dive into the deep unreal".  In the closing paragraph, the author revisits the topic he opened with in his previous piece, writing that "In the edition of [Melody Maker|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody_Maker] immediately following the Empire Pool shows, even 'Bolan Mania' had taken a backseat: most of the front page was devoted to a huge picture of Garcia and his new customized Stratocaster, accompanied by a headline reading [in all caps] 'Dead storm Britain'."

===''Europe '72, Vol. 3: City Hall, Newcastle, England (4/11/1972)''===

In the liner notes for the show on 4/11/1972 Sam Cutler opens by describing the venue as "a dour concrete building in the midst of a grim industrial town" and stating that "the Grateful Dead were initially dismayed&mdash;it had all the warmth of a witch's teat."  He goes on to say that "the band transcended the limitations of the space" and ultimately the "stunned and bemused" audience "began to relax and get into the music" which "produced many a manic grin".  Rosie McGee adds to Sam's short contribution with her tale of meeting and sitting for a while with "a very nice lady", the mother of [Eric Burdon|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Burdon] of [The Animals|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals], who "reached over and took my hand" at one point and, "Knowing she couldn't be heard over the music, she mouthed the words 'They're very good, you know!' and then smiled and patted my hand."
