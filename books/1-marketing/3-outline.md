# Core Ideas

Ideas for addressing a want, pain, or fear - which is what Seth Godin suggests - in my first ebook:

- Death: yours and mine
  - You cannot answer the questions when you are dead
- Grojas: only way to really preserve your personality
  - You will never see your personality unless I do it before you die
- Fear: are you afraid of your own subconscious?

More positive ideas:

- Understand where others are coming from.

Probably want to put these near the beginning.

**Use criticism sandwich idea - put the negative between two positives.**

# Title Ideas

- The Why, What, Who, and How of Spiritual Portraits
- The Who, What, Why, and How of Spiritual Portraits


# Outline

## Preface: It's Really Quite Simple

No matter who we are, as we go through life we are constantly:

- Observing: perceiving, gathering and assimilating information, and
- Doing things: making decisions based on our observations - and observing the results

Each of us has a preference for doing one of these more than the other - and **that preference may be great or small.**

A few preferences like this are the content of the images - the Spiritual Portraits or Grojas[x] - I create.

Personalities are abstract things, so the images are abstract.

## Questions:

- Are you as happy as you could be?
- Would you like to know why some people just rub you the wrong way, right from the start?
- Do you really know yourself?
- Do you ever wonder why other people aren't more like you?
- Could your relationships be better?
- Do you ever wonder where other people are coming from?
- Would you like to know why you relate to some fictional characters better than others?
- Do you go through life without direction, just responding to things, like flotsam?
- Etc., "as many as possible"
- Would you like to know why
- Do you ever wonder why

**Grojas can help with all of these issues**


## Prelude/Forward/Introduction

### Why: Selling Points

These should address **all** questions in the previous section.

- Gain insight into recurring people problems
- Wake up - increase awareness of self and others
  - It's always nice to bring unconscious information to the surface
- All of us are expressing these traits in our daily actions
  - Take control - choose self-knowledge over floating through life like flotsam
  - Many of us are already subconsciously processing this information to varying degrees
  - All I am doing is making the invisible visible
- Good to know what sort of work you are best suited for
  - For example, if you are naturally drawn to work that is easily automated, wouldn't you want to know about it?
- Key Point: the images reflect the strength of the preferences
  - People with mild preferences are very different from those with strong preferences - and the images reflect that
  - Strong preferences in particular are visible immediately
    - Meyers-Briggs warns repeatedly that a strong supporting function is essential for all types
    - For example: stubbornness and haplessness


### What:

[Don't go too deep - for details refer to the How-to]

#### What do you do?

What do you do in your life?

No matter who you are, you:

Open ourselves to observing things
- See, hear, touch, smell, and taste
  - Even animals and machines can do these things
- After awhile, we begin to see patterns and get ideas
  - In general humans are better at these things than animals and machines

Process our observations to make decisions
- Many decisions are subconscious: reflexive, instinctive, and habitual
- After awhile, we develop a tendency to:
  - Make logical decisions that are consistent and determined by external circumstances
  - Make emotional decisions that can vary and are determined by how we feel at the moment
  - Consciously consider both alternatives and pick the one best suited to the situation

In most people, one of these - observing or deciding - takes precedence.
In a minority of people - I call them "chameleonesque" - these tendencies are balanced.

Finally, people tend to direct their dominant preference either outwardly or inwardly.

#### What do the images represent?

- Introduce what Grojas are:
  - The images must be abstract because personalities are abstract
  - They are based on Jungian Achetypes
    - Myers Briggs codified and commercialized Jung's typology, and adapted his methodology into the popular four-letter type shorthand
- What each of the colors represent
  - Refer to About page on Groja.com, **do not duplicate it**
    - Possibly refer to Appendix, where there might be more information
  - Sensing-Yellow versus iNtuition-Blue
    - Three or more adjectives for each, at least one each positive, neutral, and negative
    - N vs. S - Perceptions
      - As different as night and day
      - The biggest differences between people
  - Thinking-Green versus Feeling-Red
    - Three or more adjectives for each, at least one each positive, neutral, and negative
    - F vs. T - Motivations
      - Warm vs. Cool
      - The source of most difficulties between people
- What the horizontal and vertical lines represent
  - These images use:
    - Vertical lines to represent the preference the person directs outwardly
    - Horizontal lines to represent the preference the person directs inwardly
  - When the dominant function is directed outwardly, the image contains a long vertical line to the left of the image's center
    - These are extraverts and it is usually quickly obvious who they are
  - When the dominant function is directed inwardly, the image contains a long vertical line underneath the image's center
    - These are introverts and it often takes some time to learn who they are
  - When a person's preferences are very strong, these lines may get lost, but they are there


### Who:

How to determine whether you would like to see your Spiritual Portrait.

- World's Shortest Personality Quiz - or Something
  - Instant Personality Quiz?
  - Two questions, pick where you are on the continuum
    - Use at least positive, neutral, and negative synonym on each side
    - Use the colors subtlely in the continuum - a gradient with white in the middle might be nice
    - S ------- N - where are you, on a scale of 1-10?
    - T ------- F - where are you, on a scale of 1-10?
  - What your score means:
    - If your score is 10 or more, you will like your spiritual portrait
      - The higher your score, the better chance you will like it
    - If your score is less than 10, a spiritual portrait is not for you
      - The lower your score, the less probability you will like it

- How it works
  - Personality traits and images of personalities are abstract
    - If you are more N than S,
    - If you are more Blue than Yellow,
    - If you prefer ideas to facts,
    - If you are more comfortable with abstractions than most,
    - Then you will understand the images more easily
  - Personality traits and images of personalities are all about people
    - If you are more F than T,
    - If you are more Red than Green,
    - If you prefer emotions to logic,
    - If you'd rather work with people than things,
    - Then you will understand the images more easily


### Conclusion - The Pitch

**Review Daniel Pink's book before completing this section.**

#### Benefits

Grojas can help with:

- Self-awareness
- Relationships - personal & professional teams - explain how briefly
- Etc. - review salient points from the Selling Points section.

#### Pricing

Pricing is variable.
If you see us running a special offer, you would be wise to take advantage of it.

- Increased demand:
  - May well drive up the price of hand-crafted images
  - May push me to better automate production, so the price will always be reasonable
- Images of similar personalities will look similar, but no two images will never be identical

#### FAQ

[Idea: resist the temptation to add a FAQ until we actually have real live questions that are getting asked frequently.]

### Appendix: How to Draw a Personality

This will be **the definitive, detailed How-to,** to be excerpted from and adapted into articles for posting on social networking sites.

So it's ok to delve into details.  Dive away!

Consider doing all or portions of this as an infographic - see TODOs below.

- Choose what qualities you want to portray
  - For example, Jungian, Big 5, something from the DSM, etc.
- Find a questionnaire
  - Find an existing questionnaire that is OK to use, or write your own, or both
- Decide how to represent the qualities
  - For example, what shapes and colors to use for these traits, what types vectors for those traits, etc.
- Consider writing a program to do the work
  - Writing a program to convert the results to an image is **not** necessary, but it makes it easy to create consistent images
- Obtain personality profiles and draw them!
  - Get people to answer the questionnaire

- TODOs:
  1. Adapt this into an infographic and post to pinterst
  2. Adapt this How-to into an article and post to medium
